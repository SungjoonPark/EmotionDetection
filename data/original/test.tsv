Excuse me?	27	ef5wsk1

but you won't hear that from most of the press or people on this sub WHAT IS THEIR POLICY THOUGH lmao	1	eeorxwd
A friend calls this shadow work. I think you're right. It takes a lot of courage and persistence.	4	edzwslf
You know it’s bad when you grab the toothpaste and start reading it	3	edqjvo0
Who was it? I got here after it was deleted, and I'd like to read the comment history.	7	edcm3cr
On reflection I might've been harsh on [NAME], but Bandai's existence was forgettable like a swing flashback in Naruto.	22	eduxkh8
I'm surprised that this is still happening despite the threats of an invasion of manbij.	26	eetrfd1
And then everyone clapped	27	eex08xg
I have little to no anxiety and it really helps me when i have to take a test.	23	efafosi
Thanks for the P.S	15	efbnv71
This cheat... what would that be? I may have made a choice I'm currently regretting.	7,24	ed2qpz3
Didn't that used to be the Northern Bank building? Never been troubled by pickpockets in Bangor but probably because I looked too poor!	7,12	ed219du

Thanks for the advice I really appreciate it and I hope you're doing better now!	0,15	edk6w8j
That dad must love monster high as well.	18	eddktov
I’m curious what is their concern and their purpose to be plus-size people influencers regarding the fact that they do not belong to that group?	27	eect4wn
Watching [NAME] flip his head back every poke of contact is possibly the most frustrating thing to watch	3,27	ef4vuyy
Also them dealing with mean and petty people especially in school	27	eda3seg
"Okay. I mean 18% of the words in the comment you replied to were ""Times"", but okay"	27	eex2z2r
Street Samurai Koji and Ojiisan Koji are my personal favorites. Greased Lightning Koji is pretty fun as well.	18	ee9jvfx
THIS!!	13	eerr82c
That was my mistake. It should only show your First Name and The 1st letter of my last name.	24	ee7toae
Hasn’t hurt me none	10	efag0ql
They never seem to think this when the police arrive, with their guns, to end a terrible situation. 	27	edwyapx
Honestly, if you did not, then you were watching the video incorrectly.	10	edi4u1a
This is why I love politics. It really shows how stupid people are.	18	ef64yoh
Good point, thank you for the correction	15	eegfgs5

Most non immigrants won't do farm work for peanuts either	27	ed8yx1p
Shaming men for trying to solve a problem on their own is actually an example of toxic femininity	27	eeutvg2
Calm down snowflake. Comment stalking from a week ago is really sad, especially when you're whining about something that I'm 100% right on. 	25	edk6gbr
It really sucks people are downvoting you just because they were worried about blowing themselves up just like us nova bomb users.	3	eejj57x
Downvote. These slippers cute as hell.	27	eevg200
Ah fair enough. Thanks for elaborating	15	edn65tb
Tough times don't last tough people do... Die'n is easy, living isn't, make the best of it	4	ee4kmno

You played torb....... that’s why. Just kidding that’s really weird though	10	efe8j5d
So this is how democracy dies... With thunderous upvotes.	2	ee92had
Yes, I’m sure [NAME] biggest concern is New Japan getting criticism on Reddit.	4	eeu5mfp
Why do you keep going back the them? Why should care about hillbillies?	6	eeetsyl
The first sentence alone sums it all up 😂	4	ef2hcbw
He was only thrown in there so we could have [NAME] get heroically saved by him and so we would hate [NAME]	27	efag9qk
EDIT: wrong link sorry here’s the right one I hope	24	efdhrfd

Fuck [NAME] pai	2	eep6w1l
I literally got the same bug	9	eegfjlp
I agree with your guy. Sex can sometimes improve with the adulterous partner, because he/she feels desired and sexy again.	4	efdwddq
Someone get us a [NAME] version of the [NAME] nice lead meme!!!	8	ee8yy8w
He’s probably just getting stressed out that it is now getting dark and he lives in the countryside	27	edhgiy7
That’s an insult!! To fecal matter.	9	ee63efc
Chicken and the egg argument. Gun companies don't donate to [NAME] *because* they have gun control on their platform. This goes back decades mind you.	27	eduge0v
I have to cuddle my dog so hard right now.	5,18	edk3huj
People on Reddit barely know anything about law but they love to get riled up about the little that they do know	18	ed2uyol
I admit I’ll be fairly happy if we continue to invest in young internationals and sign a $100+ mil free agent every offseason.	4,17	ednculf
Any rap song because I hate it	2	ed2hvlf
BERNIE OR BUST	27	eezvpdn
Before the trade happened I knew [NAME] was [NAME] but [NAME] beauty had not reached me yet	9	eeqmptc
That’s horrible. What country? If you don’t mind. My [NAME] was abused by her heavily religious (Pentecostal) father.	14	efh50bc
I thought they held hands while they and [NAME] were watching TV ([NAME] was pretending to be sick in that episode)?	27	ef2u519
I wondered where the quote about “supporting your azz” and was very pleased to finally find the train wreck that said it.	26	ed3mf1l
Reacting to [NAME] at this point just makes me feel worse about the artist.	3,11	efgt3q2
Ok, thank you and thanks for the LPT. Cold leftover food is great sometimes like cold pizza, cold meatballs, etc...	15	ed27iy5
What's up with all the gloating.	7	edyb804
[NAME] x [NAME] sounds cute for some reason.	0	eduuk6t
Thanks, now every highlander I run into tries to do it 100% of the time and I just bait them into a light parry	15	edh94dx
I know man, however in some ways it's a good way to act out a martyr complex. 	4	edixbsb
> punishment for saying no to rape Surely if you wanted to rape someone you'd have to punish them for saying yes...	2	edbyvi1
Weird, I checked again and it works for me now. It wasn't the first few times I tried to click.	27	edt9956
Thank you for the detailed response. It’s about time I worry about making myself happy rather than them.	15	ed41m72

So you’re telling me [NAME] hasn’t got a baby face?	27	ed8jisf
[NAME] gets a lot of unfair criticism. [NAME], too	10	ef12vk6
Sending you some Ramona wine as thanks!	15	efgjczx

To be fair, I will also continue to jerk off to pictures of [NAME] in shorts He looks so good in them	0,4	edlk1zx

Lol.... i guess your personal experience explains everything.... personally I've seen this play out numerous times in the work place..... so.....	1,22	eesyhd2
Super unflattering. [NAME] is not overweight but this ensemble made her appear chunky.	10	ee52iny
Wow that's a really great explanation. Makes sense!	0	ef9ibsj
Your manager sounds like an idiot. Not saying he/she is. Just sounds like it from this.	2	edm9lwz

Please dont put words into my mouth.I never said rape isnt a problem.	3	efa80q4

 Now, can you make another applet to change his wallpaper?	27	eer0hlf
I did and found it basically the same except I was getting drunk very easily.	4	eeuer5u
Weird, though. So many people love to identify themselves by their corporate loyalty.	27	eepf1aq
Thanks, I love it.	15,18	edgkwiy
Ok, thats my thinking too. If [NAME] really only gets 180 anyone who didn't make that deal (like us) is pretty dang foolish.	3,9	eevggs1
Highgate Hill! Close to westend and has a lot of cute houses. :)	27	edtbcto

"BT In the commentary booth: ""Where's your god [NAME]?"" As she's being mauled by a lion"	26,27	eetgibp
It’s a facepalm just for the wrong reason	9,27	eebf1m4
"Because there's such a thing as ""too good to be true"" and some people are still skeptical of that."	27	edw65t1
He seemed like he was about to run away and go do some meth.	27	edw5iqn
Don't know how that was missed. Tragic really. Considering the title.	9,25	eem6ixj
