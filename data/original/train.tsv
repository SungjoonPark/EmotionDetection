Same thing happened (to a slightly lesser degree) with [NAME] last year and it made for a lot of heartbreak that some never quite got over.	9	edub9tx
So everyone‚Äôs cool with the corn rolling on the floor then? alright cool.	7	ef8e9jz
Remember when the media ignored all of the horrible things [NAME] did? Including what he did to Syria?	3,9	edrk6eh
ah dang sorry. in that case idk.	24	eepw0xx
I feel uncomfortable how we didn‚Äôt see him resurface...	12	ee8xbjc
Shaun Of The Dead is way more comedy than horror, good laughs.	1	edy08de

This is extremely dangerous. And would completely marginalize anyone without a chip. Making it an absolute necessity for everyone to have a chip.	14	ee7iess
