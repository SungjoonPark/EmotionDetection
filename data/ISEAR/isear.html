   <P><U><B>Short description</B></U></P>
   <P>Over a period of many years during the 1990s, a large group of psychologists 
    all over the world collected data in the ISEAR project, directed by Klaus 
    R. Scherer and Harald Wallbott. Student respondents, both psychologists and 
    non-psychologists, were asked to report situations in which they had experienced 
    all of 7 major emotions (joy, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, shame, and guilt). 
    In each case, the questions covered the way they had appraised the situation 
    and how they reacted. The final data set thus contained reports on seven emotions 
    each by close to 3000 respondents in 37 countries on all 5 continents.</P>

    <A href="isear_databank.zip">Acces File with quantitative and qualitative 
    ISEAR data</A> (in the form of a .zip archive)</P>
   <P>For 16 of the 38 countries we were able to obtain transcriptions and English 
    translations of the situation descriptions that the participants reported 
    by writing a short text in their language in the space provided in the questionnaire. 
    These data descriptions can be found in the last column of the Access file. 
    All other information, i.e., background data, and the appraisal and reaction 
    variables, are contained in the columns before that. The meaning of the variables 
    can be lloked up in the following Word document:</P>
   <P><A href="ISEAR%20Questionnaire%20&%20Codebook.doc">ISEAR Questionnaire 
    &amp; Codebook.doc</A></P>
   <P>This file contains brief explanations of what the variable names mean. In 
    particular, a copy of the questionnaire is reproduced and the variable names, 
    as well as the labels of the different values, are provided in direct correspondence 
    to the questionnaire items.</P>
   <P>The complete quantitative data set for all of the approx. 3000 participants 
    is provided in the form of an SPSS .sav data file</P>
   <P><A href="ISEAR%20SPSS%20Databank.zip">ISEAR SPSS Data File</A> (in the form 
    of a .zip archive)</P>
   <P>Again, the variable names are explained in the Word document mentioned above. 
    There is one row for each participant. In the first columns you will find 
    the background variables, followed by seven times the set of variables, once 
    for each emotion. Thus the variable name ints3_1 refers to the felt intensity 
    for emotion 3 (anger) while ints5_1 refers to the intensity of emotion 5 (disgust), 
    etc.</P>
   <P>We hope that this information is sufficient to find one's way through the 
    data set.</P>
   <P>We would like to again acknowledge our thanks to all the many collaborators 
    who have helped to gather this impressive and unique data set. They all have 
    the status of co-authors of the papers, although, of course, the author line 
    is not sufficiently long to hold all the names. We would like to reproduce 
    the list of all collaborators on this webpahe to render homage to the time 
    and effort that was spent by all of these colleagues to collect these data, 
    often under difficult circumstances (it should be recalled that the world 
    looked differently when the study was run! Which, by the way, should be considered 
    in interpreting the data.)</P>
