"Acephalous-Cant-believe_4_47","I can't believe I wrote all that last year."
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_83_354","Because I've been grading all damn day and am as tired as a Swearengen of hearing other about the finished semesters of pretty much every other academic blogger, I thought that it might be best to avoid jealously lashing out and scribble a ""Best of Acephalous 2009"" post."
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_355_499","However, when I started looking through my archives, it occurred to me that my output this year defines me much more sharply than in years past."
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_500_515","What do I mean?"
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_517_626","The posts I consider foundational to my current professional identity all seem to have been composed in 2009."
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_627_817","Granted, the likelihood that I'm suffering from the identitarian equivalent of presentism is awfully high, but I honestly thought I'd written some of the posts from early 2009 in 2006 or so."
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_819_984","It may also be that I remember the scene of their writing, which would have been in the old apartment, i.e. the place I barely remember ever having lived in anymore."
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_986_1160","If you have absolutely nothing better to do on a Friday night, feel free to scan through my 2009 archives and tell me what you think should be included in the ""Best of"" post."
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_1162_1229","If you do have something better to do, though, by all means do it ."
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_1266_1336","Why is someone so young not having fun with friends on a Friday night."
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_1337_1409","Granted grading papers is important, but no fun makes for a boring life."
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_1410_1424","I should know."
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_1426_1520","since, when I was your age I had fun playing with my adorable son and caring for another baby."
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_1521_1574","You need to try to have a life outside your computer."
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_1575_1667","Just saying....it seems I have more life now then you have and we know how little I get out!"
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_1726_1817","The one that really stuck in my mind was explaining transitions in the panels of Watchmen ."
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_1818_2022","I'd read Watchmen a short while before and appreciated its narrative complexity, but not being used to reading comics, hadn't registered all the technical tricks that the artist was using to achieve this."
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_2023_2191","The post not only taught me something about the grammar of such images, but more importantly led to me realising that there is a grammar to look for in the first place."
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_2192_2221","So thanks a lot for that one."
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_2281_2572","SEK, I started going through your back posts and noticed a pattern in my selections, so I think it would be easier (for me, because I'm rubbish with html) to just say all the scene analysis posts and the close reading comics posts, like the one Magistra mentioned and many others after that."
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_2573_2641","Plus Justifying Comics as a Legitimate Object of Study Parts I & II."
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_2642_2690","I also liked ""Teaching the Overdetermined Image."
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_2692_2836","Your takedown of Cashill and the whole Ayers-wrote-Dreams was excellent, and the Cruel_cruel_death post (you know what I'm talking about, right?"
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_2840_2928","Also, The Day in Actual Communist and Real Nazi History seems as relevant today as ever."
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_2985_3022","Agree with the previous two comments."
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_3023_3152","I don't remember if you've made noises here before about turning these into a book, but if you do you've got at least one reader."
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_3215_3283","What happened to your post that appeared in my RSS reader yesterday?"
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_3342_3496","Would it be possible to arrange your posts into three 'parties', and give your many readers the opportunity to 'vote' for one of them, by 'secret ballot'?"
"Acephalous-Cant-believe_3497_3547","I feel your British readers would appreciate that."
"Acephalous-Internet_29_105","The Internet occasionally reminds me of how different life is because of it."
"Acephalous-Internet_107_317","I noted on Facebook that, from a statistical perspective, what makes baseball such an amazing sport is that you can watch it your entire life and still see, on a daily basis, something you’ve never seen before."
"Acephalous-Internet_319_388","It’s a truism, I know, but it has the benefit of actually being true."
"Acephalous-Internet_390_553","In this case, the something in question was watching the wonderfully named Angel Pagan hit an inside-the-park home run and initiate a triple play in the same game."
"Acephalous-Internet_554_745","John Emerson responded with some humbug about it not being an inside-the-park grand slam, which made me remember that I had seen an inside-the-park grand slam at some time in the remote past."
"Acephalous-Internet_746_1108","I remember being six or seven years old and watching the Mets play the Cardinals in an afternoon game at Shea Stadium, and thanks to the miracle of the Internet, I can definitively say that at approximately 4:30 p.m. on 9 June 1985 , I watched Terry Pendleton hit an inside-the-park grand slam off Joe Sambito in a game the Cardinals would go on to win handily."
"Acephalous-Internet_1108_1269","The fact that I can verify vague memories of events that occurred twenty-five years ago astounds me in a way I sometimes forget the Internet is capable of doing."
"Acephalous-Internet_1270_1472","This realization is obviously not of world-historical importance, merely a reminder that this thing whose existence we take for granted daily represents a fundamentally weird complement to human memory."
"Acephalous-Internet_1473_1658","The fact that at some point in the future I can know who I rode in an elevator with on 28 December 2005 is less weird because I chose to write about riding in an elevator with Grimace ."
"Acephalous-Internet_1659_1776","That I can access detailed information about events I have no right remembering in detail is another matter entirely."
"Acephalous-Internet_1782_1794","Joe Sambito."
"Acephalous-Internet_1795_1799","Wow."
"Acephalous-Internet_1800_1835","I'd completely forgotten about him."
"Acephalous-Internet_1836_1911","I sometimes wish I could forget that Pendelton is the Braves hitting coach."
"Acephalous-Internet_1912_2036","Closest I came to that was watching Dale Murphy get tagged out at the plate on what would have been an inside-the-park slam."
"Acephalous-Internet_2095_2234","He pitched for the Astros before he came to the Mets, stayed for '85, then he pitched for the Red Sox against the Mets in '86 World Series."
"Acephalous-Internet_2235_2298","I remember him being ineffective, and as it turns out, he was ."
"Acephalous-Internet_2299_2485","Now that I remember him, which I didn't before, I remember him as being the pitcher who'd pitched for 1) the team the Mets faced to get to the '86 Series and 2) the one they faced in it."
"Acephalous-Internet_2486_2550","I didn't remember that I remember that, but now that I do, I do."
"Acephalous-Internet_2551_2597","Memory, as Gertrude Stein would say, is funny."
"Acephalous-Internet_2652_2750","Apparently the drug use, sexual excess, and weird UCI experiences haven't softened your brain yet."
"Acephalous-Internet_2752_2842","What's really bothersome, though, is when you only remember things from your distant past."
"Acephalous-Internet_2845_2974","My grandpa was alert till the end, but when I last saw him at age 92 everything he wanted to talk about was 70 years in the past."
"Acephalous-Internet_3039_3135","A guess, but perhaps your grandfather's life at 22 was more interesting than the ensuing 70 yrs."
"Acephalous-Internet_3201_3237","You know what makes this post great?"
"Acephalous-Internet_3238_3258","No stinking cricket."
"Acephalous-Internet_3320_3487","Yeah, I remember Sambito from the Astros (when the Braves were in the old NL West because it made sense to have a team 3,000 miles from most of their division rivals)."
"Acephalous-Internet_3488_3514","Solid pitcher for a while."
"Acephalous-Internet_3515_3545","But burned out toward the end."
"Acephalous-Internet_3546_3594","Apparently, he is a player's representative now."
"Acephalous-Internet_3653_3671","Prosthetic memory."
"Acephalous-Internet_3728_3829","I like to read about others watching baseball more than I like to watch baseball by a factor of nine."
"Acephalous-Internet_3830_3982","Having given up on watching the actual sport, mention of baseball now only sparks memories of The Old Man and the Sea and the old time baseball writers."
"Acephalous-Internet_3983_4198","It is true that at the end of time, the old time baseball writers will be hailed as the very best writers, as they had access to an event that was susceptible to beautiful writing, but horrendous to watch in person."
"Acephalous-Internet_4199_4253","Plus, they smoked a prodigious quantity of cigarettes."
"Acephalous-Internet_4256_4321","nota bene: An overdue library book is a crime against Humanities."
"Anti-Terrorist_4_65","The Anti-Terrorist - Undermining The Motivation For Terrorism"
"Anti-Terrorist_68_120","By Rev. Bill McGinnis , Director - LoveAllPeople.org"
"Anti-Terrorist_123_233","This website and everything on it is in the Public Domain, so you may use it freely, even without attribution."
"Anti-Terrorist_239_270","BACKGROUND , September 11, 2004"
"Anti-Terrorist_272_408","Three years have now gone by since the September 11th attacks in 2001, and terrorism is a far greater threat to us now than it was then."
"Anti-Terrorist_409_531","The number and severity of terrorist attacks worldwide has increased dramatically, as has the number of active terrorists."
"Anti-Terrorist_532_697","Before 9/11, terrorism was confined to a small number of extremist individuals, loosely linked by radical Islam and hatred of Israel and its sole supporter, the USA."
"Anti-Terrorist_698_837","Now, many more moderate Muslims have become radicalized, world-wide, willing to kill innocent civilians in order to achieve their purposes."
"Anti-Terrorist_838_1024","And the serious targets have expanded to include civilians in Russia, India, Maylasia, the Philippines, Spain, and elsewhere, as well as Israel and its sole supporter, the United States."
"Anti-Terrorist_1025_1135","True, the USA has not suffered a successful major attack since 9/11, but this does not mean that we are safer."
"Anti-Terrorist_1136_1254","The terrorists could strike any time they choose, through any of the numerous loopholes so well reported in our media."
"Anti-Terrorist_1255_1425","But they have chosen not to attack, perhaps because they are waiting to produce an effect even greater than the 9/11 attacks, so they do not appear to be losing strength."
"Anti-Terrorist_1426_1479","What could be more spectacular than the 9/11 attacks?"
"Anti-Terrorist_1480_1488","Nuclear!"
"Anti-Terrorist_1489_1520","Or massive bio-chemical attack!"
"Anti-Terrorist_1521_1567","And I think this is what they are waiting for."
"Anti-Terrorist_1568_1810","All of our frantic preparations may have had some effect in preventing small-time casual attacks, but they cannot stop a serious planned attack, any more than a mere door lock can stop a serious robber who really wants to get into your house."
"Anti-Terrorist_1812_1901","So the Bush administration can keep claiming that we are safer now, under their policies."
"Anti-Terrorist_1902_1988","But this claim is merely feel-good propaganda, intended to keep the neo-cons in power."
"Anti-Terrorist_1989_2031","It cannot withstand clear-headed scrutiny."
"Anti-Terrorist_2032_2130","The fact is, Bush policies have failed completely even to diminish terrorism, much less defeat it."
"Anti-Terrorist_2131_2273","By trying to ""stamp out"" terrorism by killing terrorists, Bush and Israel have made things infinitely worse for us: more dangerous, not safer."
"Anti-Terrorist_2274_2389","And proof that Bush has failed may come at any moment, explosively, with one big successful attack here in the USA."
"Anti-Terrorist_2391_2411","May God help us all."
"Anti-Terrorist_2413_2431","WHAT IS TERRORISM?"
"Anti-Terrorist_2433_2590","TERRORISM is ""the systematic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective."
"Anti-Terrorist_2669_2828","We believe that any terrorist act is a crime against humanity and against the will of God, because it deliberately intends to injure and kill innocent people."
"Anti-Terrorist_2830_2852","NEUTRALIZING TERRORISM"
"Anti-Terrorist_2854_2932","Our purpose here is to NEUTRALIZE TERRORISM by removing the motivation for it."
"Anti-Terrorist_2933_3013","Without motivation, terrorism will quickly die down, like a plant without water."
"Anti-Terrorist_3016_3174","We completely reject the idea that terrorism can be defeated by brute force, because brute force radicalizes the moderates, and they then join the terrorists."
"Anti-Terrorist_3175_3220","So you end up fighting the entire population."
"Anti-Terrorist_3221_3284","Brute force has failed in Palestine, and it is failing in Iraq."
"Anti-Terrorist_3287_3656","We try to be even-handed in opposing all terrorism, although we recognize that the greatest terrorist threat in the world today comes from radical Muslims who falsely believe that Allah approves of their criminal behavior against Israel, The United States, Russia, India, the Philippines, Australia, and others whom they falsely believe to be ""waging war against Allah."
"Anti-Terrorist_3658_3885","And the second-greatest terrorist threat comes from several countries, mainly Israel, who sometimes resort to terrorism themselves, claiming ""self-defense,"" as they desperately try to prevent further attacks by radical Muslims."
"Anti-Terrorist_3886_4028","In all of these cases above, if the radical Muslims would cease their attacks, all terrorism on both sides of every dispute would quickly end."
"Anti-Terrorist_4031_4279","Beyond these two sources, there is virtually no terrorist activity in the world, with the possible exception of localized disputes such as in Northern Ireland and occasional domestic episodes in various places involving isolated disaffected groups."
"Anti-Terrorist_4282_4370","The moral and religious theories which support terrorism are quite faulty and erroneous."
"Anti-Terrorist_4371_4411","They need to be identified and attacked."
"Anti-Terrorist_4412_4509","If the terrorist loses faith in the righteousness of his acts, he is less likely to perform them."
"Anti-Terrorist_4513_4550","EXAMPLE 1: ""Terrorists Offend Allah."""
"Anti-Terrorist_4553_4620","EXAMPLE 2: ""Terrorist Murderers Insult Allah, Bring Shame To Islam"""
"Anti-Terrorist_4623_4694","EXAMPLE 3 (LATEST AND BEST! - Framed Below): ""Qur'an Forbids Terrorism"""
"Anti-Terrorist_4697_4783","In every case of terrorism, we will find some kind of legitimate underlying grievance."
"Anti-Terrorist_4784_4869","If we eliminate the legitimate grievances, we have eliminated much of the motivation."
"Anti-Terrorist_4872_4990","Is this ""negotiating with terrorists"" or ""trying to appease the terrorists,"" as some Israeli/NeoCons would try to say?"
"Anti-Terrorist_4991_4994","No."
"Anti-Terrorist_4995_5070","It is simply recognizing the realities of human motivation, right or wrong."
"Anti-Terrorist_5071_5156","To deny reality, as the Israeli/NeoCons do, is to invite disaster, as they have done."
"Anti-Terrorist_5159_5170","BIG PICTURE"

"blog-monastery_803_846","I like learning new things, so I signed up."
"blog-monastery_847_1074","A good decision: I didn't return all chill and zen, as one friend told me his roommate had, but I certainly gained a few new ideas and approaches to mull over, and dipped my hand into a previously unfamiliar piece of the world."

"blog-monastery_1101_1325","The first evening, the twenty-something students--most from my college, four from another--gathered in the shrine room, sitting cross-legged on cushions as we listened to Khenpo Kalsang introduce Tibetan Buddhist philosophy."

"blog-monastery_1622_1720","You believe the other medicine may have just as much value, but in other situations, not this one."
"blog-monastery_1722_1858","We discussed the foundations: the Three Turnings of the Wheel of Dharma; the four noble truths; karma; defilements; the six perfections."
"blog-monastery_1859_2159","When we talked about the giving, and how one should try to give what one could to other sentient beings (in the form of material items, kind words, protection, and so on), Khenpo Kalsang shared a story of the Buddha, and how the Buddha had given his flesh so that a family of hungry tigers could eat."

"blog-monastery_2568_2593","Knowing and understanding"
"blog-monastery_2595_2682","Later, I talked to the resident nun, Ani Kunga, about psychology and cognitive science."

"blog-new-year's-resolutions_1072_1172","They suggested that what you believe about self-control affects the goals you set and achieve [PDF]."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_1174_1240","In the paper, ""self-control"" is used to mean a sense of willpower."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_1188_1202","""self-control"""
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_1241_1572","Mukhopadhyay & Venkatarmani discuss various lay theories of self-control, noting that the amount of self-control a person has can be seen as either an inherently limited or unlimited resource, and that this resource can be seen either as malleable or as fixed (the amount of self-control a person has can change over time, or not)."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_1573_1737","An important premise to note here is the idea that the probability of choosing a goal or making a resolution increases if a person thinks that goal can be attained."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_1738_1817","So if you think you'll be able to achieve a goal, you're more likely to set it."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_1818_1972","Combine this with theories of self-control, and in general, if you believe you have unlimited stores of self-control, you'll set a larger number of goals."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_1973_2050","If you believe self-control is malleable but limited, you'll set fewer goals."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_2052_2190","Mukhopadhyay & Venkatarmani also discuss self-efficacy: belief in one's capabilities, the perceived ability to carry out a desired action."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_2191_2524","They propose that people with high self-efficacy--people who believe that failure is the result of insufficient effort, and thus exhibit increased commitment and persistence--will achieve more of their goals than people with low self-efficacy, who tend to view failure as the result of deficient ability, and thus may simply give up."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_2526_2537","The studies"
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_2539_2669","In the first study, 85 participants (all college students) each read one of four passages presenting lay theories of self-control."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_2670_2844","Each passage contained two paragraphs; the first discussed self-control either as limited or as unlimited, and the second discussed self-control as either malleable or fixed."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_2845_3042","The participants then answered questions about their belief in each of two theories presented, followed by a second questionnaire to assess motivation, in which they listed all their current goals."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_3044_3189","The study was testing whether a belief in unlimited, malleable self-control would result in most resolutions, and indeed, this is what was found."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_3190_3411","The experimenters had some concerns about participants' natural beliefs in relation to the passages they read, however, so in study two, the order of the two measures (lay theories and motivation/goal listing) was varied."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_3412_3655","Data from 130 new participants revealed that, as hypothesized, if the motivation & goals questionnaire were assessed first, then among the people who believed self-control is malleable, those who also believed self-control to be unlimited (vs."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_3656_3680","limited) set more goals."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_3681_3741","When lay theories were assessed first, this result reversed."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_3742_3818","The people who believed that self-control is fixed were unaffected by order."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_3820_3916","The third study moved on to examine goal achievement, adding a measure to look at self-efficacy."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_3917_3971","The study had two sessions, in November then February."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_3972_4362","In the first session , the 159 participants read passages about lay theories (much like in study one, but with longer passages to strengthen the manipulation), listed the resolutions they were planning on making at New Years, rated how disappointed they would be if they failed to keep their resolutions, and filled out individual difference measures (which included a self-efficacy scale)."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_4363_4517","Only 86 participants successfully returned for the second session, during which they indicated how much success they had had at keeping their resolutions."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_4519_4560","What does this mean for your resolutions?"
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_4562_4750","The resolutions made by participants across all conditions were qualitatively similar (take a look at any list of popular New Year's resolutions, and you'll see the majority of the goals)."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_4751_5009","As shown in the first two studies, more goals were set by people who believe self-control is unlimited and malleable than by any other people--that is, if you expect more success, you may increase the difficulty and number of tasks that you set for yourself."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_5010_5074","Self-efficacy did not have a significant effect on goal-setting."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_5076_5174","As far as success goes, only the interaction between lay theory and self-efficacy was significant."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_5175_5321","If participants believed in limited self-control and were low in self-efficacy, they tended to give up more often, failing to achieve their goals."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_5322_5535","But if participants believed in unlimited self-control, self-efficacy had no effect; participants achieved just as many goals regardless, and people who set more resolutions were marginally more likely to succeed."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_5537_5788","Mukhopadhyay & Venkatarmani realize that their research does not directly look at the relationship between lay theories of self-control and beliefs about one's own amount of self-control and self-efficacy, and propose this as an area for future study."
"blog-new-year's-resolutions_5789_5999","But in general, lay theories about self-control can determine how much success you'll expect (and thus, how many goals you'll set), and self-efficacy beliefs can determine how much success you'll actually have."

"Fermentation_Eminent-Domain_97_347","I was disappointed, though not surprised, to see that today a conjunctive labeling law dictating that ""Sonoma County"" be placed on every label on wines produced from grapes grown in Sonoma County was unanimously passed by the California Legislature ."
"Fermentation_Eminent-Domain_348_547","Pushed as an effort to promote ""Sonoma County"" wines and a consumer education effort, the new law instead forces vintners to needlessly sully their package and undermines their own marketing efforts."

"Fermentation_Eminent-Domain_596_731","Passed unanimously out of the California Assembly and Senate, AB 1798 now awaits the Governor's signature, which it will surely obtain."
"Fermentation_Eminent-Domain_732_1063","According to Noreen Evans, an Assembly sponsor of the bill, this new conjunctive labeling law ""requires that any wine labeled with an American Viticultural Area (AVA) located entirely within Sonoma County - – like Russian River Valley or Dry Creek Valley - must also include the word ""Sonoma County"" on the label, starting in 2014."
"Fermentation_Eminent-Domain_1064_1099","There are 13 AVAs in Sonoma County."
"Fermentation_Eminent-Domain_1101_1310","The problem, of course, is that by placing the words ""Sonoma County"" on a bottle of wine that is made with grapes grown in ""Russian River Valley"", ""Dry Creek Valley"", ""Sonoma Valley"" or any other AVA in Sonoma"
"Fermentation_Eminent-Domain_1311_1383","County, consumers learn absolutely nothing about the wine in the bottle."
"Fermentation_Eminent-Domain_1384_1752","There no evidence that grapes grown in ""Sonoma County"" have any single distinguishing feature derived from the fact that they were grown inside the borders of Sonoma County. Assemblywoman Evans concludes, ""By improving consumer education on each bottle, conjunctive labeling will unleash the full potential of our delicious wines to represent Sonoma around the world."
"Fermentation_Eminent-Domain_1754_1768","She's correct."
"Fermentation_Eminent-Domain_1769_2026","Beginning in 2014, ""Sonoma County"" will receive a tremendous boost in recognition due to the conjunctive labeling law that forces vintners to add more wording to their labels—whether they think the words ""Sonoma County"" help or hurt their marketing efforts."

"How_soon-Fans_160_248","Oh, the numbers look good, but when you dig a little deeper a different picture emerges."
"How_soon-Fans_249_356","Walls filled with off topic conversations at best, vile language and real antipathy for the brand at worst."
"How_soon-Fans_357_371","What happened?"
"How_soon-Fans_372_432","Wasn't having thousands of fans supposed to be a good thing?"
"How_soon-Fans_433_450","Well, yes and no."
"How_soon-Fans_451_506","Sure, it's great having several hundred thousands fans."
"How_soon-Fans_507_546","But how did you come to get those fans?"
"How_soon-Fans_547_788","Did you earn them through fantastic customer service, fulfilling the brand promise, providing value to the community in an authentic and passionate voice, or did you run a Facebook ad campaign and hit the broadcast airwaves with a promotion?"
"How_soon-Fans_789_954","Let's look at   my old favorite , TGI Friday's: If you can see this, then you might need a Flash Player upgrade or you need to install Flash Player if it's missing."
"How_soon-Fans_955_983","Get Flash Player from Adobe."
"How_soon-Fans_985_1002","Remember that ad?"
"How_soon-Fans_1003_1022","Pretty cool, right?"
"How_soon-Fans_1023_1083","In fact, as I recall, they got over 1 million Facebook fans."
"How_soon-Fans_1084_1139","Google TGI Friday's Fan Woody and it looks pretty good."
"How_soon-Fans_1140_1183","But then something not so awesome happened."
"How_soon-Fans_1184_1250","All those fans wanted their free burgers and they wanted them now!"
"How_soon-Fans_1251_1347","TGI Friday's completely lost control of the page and eventually doled out a lot of free burgers."
"How_soon-Fans_1348_1415","Now from a short term perspective I'm sure they did ok on the deal."
"How_soon-Fans_1416_1450","People came in and ate their food."
"How_soon-Fans_1451_1549","But they could have accomplished that with coupons in the mail, the newspaper or by an email list."
"How_soon-Fans_1550_1596","But they decided to go the Social Media route."

"How_soon-Fans_1690_1700","It's gone."
"How_soon-Fans_1701_1751","Apparently Woody and his 900,000+ fans went poof ."
"How_soon-Fans_1752_1761","How come?"
"How_soon-Fans_1762_1894","I'm guessing it had something to do with the venom and general anarchy the page had created by buying fans rather than growing them."

"How_soon-Fans_2082_2164","It's easy to pick on TGI Friday's but they certainly aren't the only guilty party."
"How_soon-Fans_2165_2232","I think plenty of brands have heard the siren call of Facebook ads."
"How_soon-Fans_2233_2419","The ability to target your demo is really terrific, but you're in danger of creating a relationship with fans that ultimately is built on a ""what have you done for me lately"" foundation."
"How_soon-Fans_2420_2461","First, you essentially bought these fans."
"How_soon-Fans_2462_2509","You paid Facebook for the right to target them."
"How_soon-Fans_2510_2642","Then in the case of TGI Friday's or other brands that offer free product or discount coupons, you are essentially buying them again."
"How_soon-Fans_2643_2773","This sets up a pattern where the consumer now expects to be rewarded for being your fan with a tangible item, that is, free stuff."
"How_soon-Fans_2774_2841","That's not a bonus item, it's now a standard part of the agreement."
"How_soon-Fans_2842_2859","Want me as a fan?"
"How_soon-Fans_2860_2879","Give me free stuff."
"How_soon-Fans_2880_3069","The point of Social Media isn't to distribute coupons and a real fan wants to engage with a brand for a whole host of reasons, often free / discounted product is the least of these reasons."
"How_soon-Fans_3070_3165","I'm not saying that special bonuses, or 'surprise and delight' offers aren't ever a good thing."
"How_soon-Fans_3166_3214","I think when used properly they can be terrific."
"How_soon-Fans_3215_3247","What do I mean by used properly?"

"Italy_121_419","As you probably noticed, my wife is currently on vacation without me -— which is different than a vacation from me, although given how frequently insufferable I am, I could understand the appeal of such—in the le Marche region of Italy, which is immediately south of Tuscany and full of communists."
"Italy_420_647","As evidence of how thoroughly corrupt the region is, I present a picture (courtesy of her) of the cabin she'll be staying in free of charge until July: That's the view she'll be writing her dissertation to the next two months."
"Italy_648_882","The region is poor (though not so much as I thought) and poorly serviced by internet and wifi: there's a router up the hill from her which sometimes provides wifi, but only then into a loft too unbearably hot to occupy during the day."
"Italy_883_1135","So the only opportunity I have to talk to her (via Skype) is that last hour in the late evening when the loft cools enough to be habitable—provided, of course, that the wifi strength that evening is strong enough to establish and maintain a connection."

"Italy_1163_1422","But this post isn't about how melancholy I become when I haven't heard from her by 3 p.m. (which would be midnight over there), because anyone who follows me on Facebook already knows that and because this post concerns Urbino, not my daily descent into emo."

"Italy_2198_2875","Into the Initiative's underground bunker: Then, from the bathroom-Initiative across the hall: Into his parent's basement: And into an ice cream truck: Past the the come-hither lesbians: Through the back of the ice cream truck: By means of a passage: That returns him to you guessed it his parents' basement: In which he exits the same door he originally entered it from Buffy's house only to end up in the halls of Sunnydale High and (shortly) an Apocalypse Now parody: The only difference between what Whedon did and Urbino is that you could travel through the side streets of Urbino with a camera and accomplish such feats (minus the Coppola) without needing to cut once ."

"Italy_3452_3917","The city is even more disturbing, though, because of the tendency of its sidewalks to transform into recessed brick ladders when the street becomes too steep for bipeds : That picture is not from the current set, as the relative quality attests, and if I remember correctly—by which I mean, ""recognize the fingerprints of amateur photographers the world over who think a 'good' photograph is one framed in the most dull and predictable way possible""—snapped by me.*"

"Seedbombing_663_782","If Mother Nature herself were perfect, she wouldn't need us urban urchins to help cover her scars with flowering seeds."
"Seedbombing_784_809","Here's where we started -"
"Seedbombing_812_868","Gift seeds of California Poppy via Jessica Reeder's mom."
"Seedbombing_869_885","Thanks, MamaHun."
"Seedbombing_888_904","2. Mix in seeds."
"Seedbombing_906_1007","Use seeds of any kind, even dumpster-salvaged ones, or the ones that might be too old for the garden."
"Seedbombing_1009_1085","You can mix them with a 30/30/40 mix of potting soil, worm casings and clay."
"Seedbombing_1086_1214","Or you could go out to the shed and grab a few handfuls of that sod mix you got at that estate sale last year and get to mixing."
"Seedbombing_1217_1244","NOTE: Cover your work area."
"Seedbombing_1245_1295","Dust can fly into your mouth and eyes very easily."
"Seedbombing_1296_1372","If the fertilizer in the mix is what I think it is, that wouldn't be pretty."
"Seedbombing_1373_1423","Use gloves to break up the soil with your fingers."
"Seedbombing_1426_1440","3. Make bombs."
"Seedbombing_1442_1516","Form the mix into balls of any size from sling-shot-pellet up to softball."
"Seedbombing_1517_1550","You're going to be throwing them."
"Seedbombing_1551_1573","Customize it yourself."
"Seedbombing_1575_1639","Mine were more or less matzoh-ball size and shape, out of habit."
"Seedbombing_1640_1668","This worked out pretty well."
"Seedbombing_1670_1742","Allow to dry overnight, or until they're solid enough for the next step."
"Seedbombing_1743_1752","4. Throw."
"Seedbombing_1754_1778","Today, I kept it simple."
"Seedbombing_1779_1859","I chose one abandoned property a few minutes from downtown, and two vacant lots."
"Seedbombing_1860_1927","The leftovers went onto the jungles alongside the freeway offramps."
"Seedbombing_1930_2011","First lesson learned -- you need at least two people to seedbomb from a vehicle ."
"Seedbombing_2012_2062","The first responsibility should be driving safely."
"Seedbombing_2063_2206","I found this hard to do while also avoiding cops, dealing with the camera and the car window, scoping out angles of approach for throwing, etc."
"Seedbombing_2208_2269","I ended up with a broken fingernail and dirt all over my lap."
"Seedbombing_2270_2293","Also, a perfect strike."
"Seedbombing_2294_2380","But you'll have to take my word because a camera at that moment would have been crazy."
"Seedbombing_2382_2450","Second Lesson -- keep the seedbombs in a shallow covered container ."
"Seedbombing_2451_2490","You want both tidiness and easy access."
"Seedbombing_2491_2522","Plus, those things are crumbly."
"Seedbombing_2523_2626","I made eight; the last two were totally pulverized after being jostled in a paper bag for half an hour."
"Seedbombing_2628_2661","And the last lesson -- have fun ."
"Seedbombing_2662_2672","It's play."
"Seedbombing_2673_2744","Seedbombing is a hit-or-miss way for change to take root, pun intended."
"Seedbombing_2745_2771","It's chlorophyll graffiti."
"Seedbombing_2772_2864","No one I know is getting digg'd or favrd yet for throwing color and scent around the ghetto."
"Seedbombing_2865_2891","Do it to see how it feels."
"Seedbombing_2892_3033","You may want to keep checking on your flowers (I promise I will) or you might get an idea to do something else completely unexpected (I did)."
"Seedbombing_3035_3112","Enzo Angolini spike heels found by serendipity at St Paul's Thrift for $3.98."
"Seedbombing_3113_3123","Sexy, non?"
"Seedbombing_3126_3317","For example, make smaller wildflower seedbombs and carefully 'plant' them in a meridian by making holes in the ground with your heel and then gently tamping the dirt over them with your sole."
"Seedbombing_3187_3194","'plant'"

"Seedbombing_3751_3852","I did it by throwing flowers all along those places no one goes, but where our planet's future lives."
"Seedbombing_3854_3940","There is one over-riding message to this -- Quit being such a goddamned perfectionist."
"Seedbombing_3941_4038","Yes, yes, I know, you know of much better places to never throw those seedbombs you haven't made."
"Seedbombing_4039_4100","You could get better soil if you put it on the shopping list."
"Seedbombing_4101_4284","You undoubtedly write much better and could have a real serious article with awesome non-blurry pictures taken by a person who actually can get the timer to work for a goddamn change."
"Seedbombing_4285_4371","The actions that you never do are absolutely perfectly effective, in your imagination."
"Seedbombing_4372_4416","But my actions accomplished something today."

"Uprooted_Bike_76_138","This post is the first of a three-part series on bike culture."
"Uprooted_Bike_139_226","Come back Friday to read about anarchy, bike jousting, and two-wheeled social protest ."
"Uprooted_Bike_228_266","Remember when you got your first bike?"
"Uprooted_Bike_267_320","Was it a Christmas present, or maybe a birthday gift?"
"Uprooted_Bike_321_411","Remember how much fun you used to have on that bike, how fast you went, how great it felt?"
"Uprooted_Bike_412_548","Well, these days, most kids want an Xbox for their birthday; their parents ride around in cars with seatbelts, talking on their phones ."
"Uprooted_Bike_549_635","Cycling is a thing of the past: a sport, a hobby, but rarely a mode of transportation."
"Uprooted_Bike_636_786","But I'm here to tell you: riding your bike is still fun, and still fast, and it's the cheapest and most socially responsible workout you'll ever get ."
"Uprooted_Bike_787_868","And there are no two ways about it: if you give a kid a bike, that kid will ride."
"Uprooted_Bike_869_910","In Troy, New York, I met one Andrew Lynn."
"Uprooted_Bike_911_1003","He's somewhat of a man brain trust , and one of his best creations is the Troy Bike Rescue ."
"Uprooted_Bike_1004_1090","It started in 2001, when Andrew would ride around town pulling bikes out of dumpsters."
"Uprooted_Bike_1091_1222","He started hosting work parties with friends in his backyard, teaching them to fix their bikes and helping them get started riding."
"Uprooted_Bike_1223_1312","Slowly but surely, the circle grew and Andrew's backyard parties became weekly workshops."
"Uprooted_Bike_1313_1423","When Andrew decided to leave town for a few years' schooling in NYC, friends and cohorts took over operations."
"Uprooted_Bike_1424_1512","By the time Andrew returned, Troy Bike Rescue (let's call it TBR) had a life of its own."
"Uprooted_Bike_1513_1620","These days it's an established club, run by volunteers and donations, turning trashed bikes into treasures."
"Uprooted_Bike_1621_1843","Its influence now includes a legitimate downtown storefront; a sister shop in Albany ( Albany Bicycle Coalition ); movie screenings and pro-cycling political events; and a dedicated core crew that keeps everything rolling."
"Uprooted_Bike_1845_1940","TBR's customers run the gamut, from businessmen to street kids to college students to families."
"Uprooted_Bike_1941_1975","The one thing they have in common?"
"Uprooted_Bike_1976_1988","They get it."
"Uprooted_Bike_1990_2111","This group understands the value of a bicycle: more than just transportation, a bike is a statement against fossil fuels."
"Uprooted_Bike_2112_2187","More than a toy, it's an equalizer that allows poor kids to ride with rich."
"Uprooted_Bike_2188_2353","More than a hobby, it's a way of traveling through the world that lets you interact, use your muscles, breathe fresh air -- all for the cost of a free dumpster bike."
"Uprooted_Bike_2356_2558","When I visited the TBR shop, it was packed with frames, wheels, gears, chains, handlebars, kids, and anarchist art (the space is being donated by some supporters who are also anti-capitalist activists)."
"Uprooted_Bike_2559_2592","TBR hosts workshops twice a week."
"Uprooted_Bike_2593_2652","For a few hours, the doors are open to anyone who walks in."
"Uprooted_Bike_2653_2725","Tools are available, and volunteers will help with advice and knowledge."
"Uprooted_Bike_2726_2850","Parts can be had for a pittance, and you can pick out your own bike from the stacks and racks of machines filling the space."
"Uprooted_Bike_2852_2905","The main focus of TBR, however, is not selling bikes."
"Uprooted_Bike_2906_2994","The idea is to give people a workspace and teach them how to maintain their own bicycle."
"Uprooted_Bike_2995_3124","Self-sufficiency is a major tenet of the bike movement, and Troy Bike Rescue is training self-reliant individuals of all stripes."
"Uprooted_Bike_3125_3201","All around me, college students and bike punks tinkered with their machines."
"Uprooted_Bike_3202_3250","An older man asked for tips on tuning his racer."
"Uprooted_Bike_3251_3453","A young kid came in to say his last bike was stolen and he needed a new one (and, despite Andrew's stern reprimand that he couldn't just walk in every week and leave with a free bike, he did just that)."
"Uprooted_Bike_3455_3597","A dad came in with his three kids, all of whom left with snazzy rides -- but first, they all sat down and worked on their new wheels together."
"Uprooted_Bike_3598_3669","And as we left at the end of the workshop, a woman walked up to Andrew."
"Uprooted_Bike_3670_3701","""I love what you do,"" she said."
"Uprooted_Bike_3670_3691","""I love what you do,"""
"Uprooted_Bike_3702_3746","""I have a whole bunch of bikes to give you."""
"Uprooted_Bike_3747_3800","See, ultimately TBR is about more than just bicycles."

"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_4856_4925","Your webpage list a number of alleged inaccuracies in Moore's movies."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_4926_5049","It is true that Moore's film is sometimes unintentionally deceptive, but to call it fraudulent is hyperbole to the extreme."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_5050_5125","It is no more so than any other successful documentary of the last decades."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_5126_5165","Let's look at some specific criticisms:"
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_5167_5228","1) The bank scene, listed on your website on a separate page."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_5229_5407","Critics have stated that this scene was ""staged"", but in the bank interview, the official tells Moore that the bank has its own vault storing about 500 weapons at any given time."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_5408_5490","It is also a licensed firearms dealer which can perform its own background checks."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_5491_5647","In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, linked from your site, an employee claims that the gun would have been ""normally"" picked up at another dealer."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_5648_5786","It is not explained what ""normally"" is supposed to mean, but that claim flatly contradicts the statement of the bank official in the film."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_5787_5942","This sounds more like a later correction for public relations purposes, but of course nobody questions the bank claims when they can be used against Moore."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_5944_5998","The only thing that Moore compressed is the timeframe."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_5999_6100","According to the same WSJ interview, ""Typically, you're looking at a week to 10 days waiting period."""
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_6036_6100","""Typically, you're looking at a week to 10 days waiting period."""
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_6101_6239","This is plausible -- but entirely irrelevant for the movie, which already makes it quite clear that a background check is being performed."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_6240_6355","Moore's detractors have sometimes extended those 7-10 days to several weeks, contradicting the bank's own estimate."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_6357_6417","There is nothing inaccurate whatsoever about the bank scene."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_6418_6522","The bank does exactly what it advertises: It hands out guns from its vault to those who open an account."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_6523_6769","The silly criticisms of the scene obscure the real obscenity of the situation: a bank handing out guns to its customers, higlighting the utter laxness of how Americans deal with deadly weapons and a love of firearms that borders on the religious."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_6771_6804","2) The Lockheed-Martin interview."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_6805_6892","This is perhaps the criticism repeated the most often, and it also the most inaccurate."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_6893_6965","First, the actual quotes from the film are often reproduced incorrectly."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_6966_6995","The dialogue goes as follows:"
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_7004_7116","""So you don't think our kids say to themselves, gee, dad goes off to the factory every day - he builds missiles."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_7117_7155","These are weapons of mass destruction."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_7156_7264","What's the difference between that mass destruction and the mass destruction over at Columbine High School?"""
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_7288_7473","""I guess I don't see that specific connection because the missiles that you're talking about were built and designed to defend us from somebody else who would be aggressors against us."""
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_7475_7522","First, note the word ""our"" in Moore's question."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_7523_7651","Moore is not from Colorado -- his question is generic, not meant to refer specifically to the Lockheed Martin plant in question."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_7652_7756","McCollum understands it this way -- otherwise he would protest against the plant being mischaracterized."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_7757_7888","However, critics of Moore have cleverly ignored McCollum's response and presented Moore as spreading lies about the Lockheed plant."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_7890_7951","Even Lockheed did not believe the public to be that gullible."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_7952_8199","In response to one Moore detractor, McCollum wrote: ""Although other units of Lockheed Martin Corporation elsewhere in the country produce weapons to support the defense of the U.S., we make no weapons at the Littleton-area facility Moore visited."""
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_8004_8199","""Although other units of Lockheed Martin Corporation elsewhere in the country produce weapons to support the defense of the U.S., we make no weapons at the Littleton-area facility Moore visited."""
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_8200_8400","Of course, critics have conveniently ignored the fact that Lockheed Martin does supply weapons of mass destruction to the US military, and that the company is the nation's largest military contractor."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_8401_8624","As Moore correctly points out, it is bizarre for a society to openly embrace the production of destructive weapons, but on the other hand see no connection of this to everyday violence -- children learn by imitating adults."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_8626_8768","Yes, Moore makes this point through slight exaggeration by moving with the camera through the LM plant -- but he makes no incorrect statement."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_8769_8941","It is typical for his critics to jump on what is at most a slightly misleading implication, but in doing so, they themselves have, unlike Moore, made many incorrect claims."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_8943_8965","3) Denver NRA meeting."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_8966_9190","Critics like yourself claim that Moore has massively distorted evidence to support his point that Charlton Heston has effectively insulted the victims of the Columbine tragedy by holding a rally in Denver shortly afterwards."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_9192_9299","First, the ""from my cold, dead hands"" part: This is used by Moore as a visual citation to introduce Heston."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_9300_9387","It is perhaps one of his most famous quotes, shown on national TV even here in Germany."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_9388_9451","It tells viewers: Aha, this is the person we are talking about."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_9452_9690","Nowhere does Moore say or imply that these words were uttered at the rally in Denver, and in fact, their reptition later in the movie at another occasion (oddly claimed by critics to be again ""misattributed"") is simply a reminder of this."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_9691_9771","It is Moore's way to say: Viewers, meet Charlton Heston, gun nut extraordinaire."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_9773_10025","The ""visual of a billboard and a narration"" is viewed by you as evidence that Moore is trying to somehow tie the two events together, when in reality, it is quite obvious that he does it to separate the introduction of Heston from his speech in Denver."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_10026_10224","Moore is a professional filmmaker -- he concentrates on maximum impact of each of the statements he cites, and to accomplish that effect, uses subtle interludes instead of long-winded introductions."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_10225_10403","This is a common technique, but because conservative readers are not familiar with the basics of filmmaking, they believe critics who claim that he is ""distorting"" the interview."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_10404_10449","What he does is standard filmmaking practice."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_10451_10497","The same goes for the interview which follows."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_10498_10680","Moore's critics would expect us to have him quote Heston in his entirety, have him present fully the PR that the NRA has used to justify its rally in Denver for reasons of ""balance""."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_10681_10849","The NRA was fully aware of the scandal it would cause through its rally and decided to push on because they believed to have enough media support to successfully do so."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_10850_10866","They were right."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_10867_11027","You claim that there was ""no way to change location, since you have to give advance notice of that to the members, and there were upwards of 4,000,000 members."""

"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_11028_11143","10 days are more than enough to give advance warning of a change in location or date, had the NRA really wanted to."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_11144_11270","It is probably correct that their primary reason for not doing so was to save money, not to piss off the victims of Colubmine."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_11271_11325","That does not change the fact that they did just that."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_11326_11423","Moore presents the most important part of the speech to back up this point and ignores the fluff."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_11424_11474","This is what good documentary filmmaking is about."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_11475_11528","And here the critics again ignore important evidence:"
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_11530_11594","When Heston mentions the mayor of Denver, the crowd boos loudly."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_11595_11773","Heston maganimously holds up a hand to read the mayor's letter (only to explain in detail why he chose to ignore the request -- not mentioning at all the reasons you have given!)"
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_11773_11774","."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_11775_12045","This booing by the crowd, not mentioned with a single word in your transcript or your article, shows that the crowd was fully aware of the controversy they would cause by coming to Littleton after children were being killed there -- and they effectively said ""Fuck you""."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_12034_12044","""Fuck you"""
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_12046_12126","To say that they could not have done otherwise is a bold lie by Moore's critics."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_12128_12154","4) The Kayla Rolland case."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_12155_12212","Again, critics like yourself charge Moore with deception."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_12213_12277","The rally took place on October 17, the shooting on February 29."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_12278_12353","Again, standard filmmaking techniques are interpreted as smooth distortion:"

"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_12510_12603","As noted above, the ""from my cold dead hands"" part is simply Moore's way to introduce Heston."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_12604_12660","Did anyone but Moore's critics view it as anything else?"
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_12661_12868","He certainly does not ""attribute it to a speech where it was not uttered"" and, as noted above, doing so twice would make no sense whatsoever if Moore was the mastermind deceiver that his critics claim he is."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_12870_13031","Concerning the Georgetown Hoya interview where Heston was asked about Rolland, you write: ""There is no indication that [Heston] recognized Kayla Rolland's case."""

"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_13032_13179","This is naive to the extreme -- Heston would not be president of the NRA if he was not kept up to date on the most prominent cases of gun violence."

"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_13422_13617","This is one valid criticism, but far from the deliberate distortion you make it out to be; rather, it is an example for how the facts can sometimes be easy to miss with Moore's fast pace editing."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_13618_13906","The reason the sentence is highlighted is not to deceive the viewer into believing that Heston hurried to Flint to immediately hold a rally there (as will become quite obvious), but simply to highlight the first mention of the name ""Kayla Rolland"" in the text, which is in this paragraph."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_13908_14071","Unfortunately, because the zooming is rather fast, it is easy to miss the rest of the sentence, so as you correctly note, some viewers got an incorrect impression."

"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_14167_14244","However, the claim of deliberate distortion is ludicrous for several reasons:"
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_14246_14327","a) Moore clearly states that ""before he came to Flint"", Heston gave an interview."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_14275_14300","""before he came to Flint"""
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_14328_14397","In the excerpt from said interview, we can see that it is from March."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_14398_14508","If Moore wanted to deceive his viewers, why would he say this, and show the month the interview was published?"
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_14510_14661","b) Why should Moore leave the words ""Clinton is on the Today Show"" visible in the text, which is necessary to correctly interpret the highlighted part?"
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_14662_14762","I reviewed the sequence several times and it is perfectly possible to see this text without pausing."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_14764_14921","c) Both the ""soccer mom"" interview and the sequences showing the NRA rally make no effort to distort the fact that this rally happened months after the fact."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_14922_15086","The camera lingers on Bush/Cheney posters, and the protestor is quoted as saying that ""we wanted to let the NRA know that we haven't forgotten about Kayla Rolland""."

"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_15087_15395","You make the hysterical claim that the interview ""may be faked"" (on the basis that no name is shown for the interviewee), but if Moore had faked it, why the hell should he put this sentence in the protestor's mouth, which directly contradicts the conclusion that the rally happened hours after Kayla's death?"
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_15396_15462","Why did Moore, the masterful deveiver, not edit this sequence out?"

"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_15485_15716","Opinions may vary on how tasteless it was for Heston to hold a pro gun rally on the location of the nation's youngest school shooting months after the fact, but this sequence of ""Bowling"" is without doubt the most unfair to Heston."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_15717_15911","The claims of deliberate distortion don't hold up when viewing the whole scene, though -- as ""Hanlon's Razor"" states, one should never attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence."

"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_16580_17247","After the Flint rally comes a brief TV interview with Heston, where he is asked about Kayla Rolland (again, clear evidence that the local media in Flint raised questions about the NRA's presence), then an inteview with country prosecutor Arthur Busch, entirely ignored by critics of the film, who also mentions Heston's presence as notable, and refers to the immediate reactions of ""people from all over America"", gun owners/groups who, according to him, reacted aggressively to warnings of having guns accessible to children, much like spanking advocates react aggressively when anti-spankers point to a case of a child being killed or severely injured by a beating."
"A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_17248_17519","These people do not feel the need to express sympathy, or to think about ways to avoid such incidents, but they feel the need to assert their ""rights"" and to look for quick, simple answers -- as Busch states, gun owners wanted to ""hang [the child] from the highest tree""."

"Ant_Robot_34_112","Proposal for a Red Harvester Ant Robot: Colony Infiltration and Task Switching"
"Ant_Robot_172_184","Introduction"
"Ant_Robot_210_220","Background"
"Ant_Robot_233_338","Science fiction writers have been anticipating humanoid androids that could pass a Turing Test for years."
"Ant_Robot_339_506","Unfortunately, as of yet, no robot has managed to fool a human for more than a few seconds, and no robot has been created that can integrate itself into human society."
"Ant_Robot_507_563","Infiltrating insect societies, however, is much simpler."
"Ant_Robot_564_803","Extensive research has been done on the interactions of social insects such as honeybees, ants and cockroaches, and in fact robots have passed undetected in cockroach society performing single simple behaviors already (Halloy et al, 2007)."
"Ant_Robot_804_1139","No robot has yet been constructed, however, that could pass undetected within a colony of the red harvester ants species Pogonomyrmex barbatus; nor has a robot managed to pass undetected in a society of insects while combining in its design several different behaviors and the thresholds of stimulation required to switch between them."
"Ant_Robot_1140_1262","Such a robot would allow for both long-term studies of ant-robot interactions and studies of task-switching in the robots."
"Ant_Robot_1263_1494","I propose here the theoretical construction and programming of a robot (hereafter referred to as Antie) that will be able to infiltrate a red harvester ant nest, switching between the foraging, patrolling and midden work behaviors."
"Ant_Robot_1520_1531","Environment"
"Ant_Robot_1544_1685","The red harvester ant lives in hot, dry deserts, building its nests in light yellowy sand and foraging for seeds deposited by winds and rain."
"Ant_Robot_1686_1920","The ants forage for more than 30 different varieties of seeds, many of which do not grow in the desert (Gordon, 54), where only a few varieties of small shrubs, small herbaceous flowering plants and short grasses do grow (Gordon, 51)."
"Ant_Robot_1921_2099","Other insects and creatures, including other species of ants, are present in the desert, but red harvester ants seem to be relatively undisturbed by these animals (Gordon, 7-11)."
"Ant_Robot_2100_2254","Though fights sometimes do break out with other red harvester ants from different nests, intraspecies interactions tend not to be aggressive (Gordon, 11)."
"Ant_Robot_2255_2368","Because of this, I will ignore other ant species in the design of Antie, and will not create a fighting behavior."
"Ant_Robot_2369_2473","Antie will be equipped to navigate in this environment and will be designed to find seeds in sandy soil."
"Ant_Robot_2499_2518","The Ant & the Robot"
"Ant_Robot_2531_2631","Ants of this species are of two types: breeding ants (queens and drones) and sterile female workers."
"Ant_Robot_2632_2834","Queens and drones will not be considered in this proposal, as their behaviors and design is much more specialized and would be applicable only during the breeding season, which occurs but once per year."
"Ant_Robot_2835_2969","The behaviors of the sterile workers may be divided into several subcategories: brood care, nest maintenance, patrolling and foraging."
"Ant_Robot_2970_3127","Little is known about brood care, as this occurs only in the deepest regions of the nest and observation would generally require the destruction of the nest."
"Ant_Robot_3128_3382","Nest maintenance and seed processing are likewise difficult to observe in the deeper regions of the nest, but the sorting and deposition of waste dirt and nest garbage outside of the nest (midden work) occurs close enough to the surface to be observable."
"Ant_Robot_3383_3579","Patrolling and foraging, too, occur for the most part outside of the nest, and have therefore been studied extensively (ex., Schafer, et al, 2006; Gordon, et al, 2002; Gordon, 2002; Gordon, 1987)."
"Ant_Robot_3580_3826","It is therefore these three behaviors that I would like to focus on in this proposal: the others remain a bit too mysterious to yet model, and the ability of a robot to pass undetected in the depths of a colony would be very difficult to observe."
"Ant_Robot_3839_3993","These three behaviors each present different puzzles to the ant and to the modeler, though there is some overlap, particularly with navigational problems."
"Ant_Robot_3994_4236","In the case of midden work, Antie must be able to identify garbage, grasp it, carry it out of the nest, and deposit it about halfway down the mound before returning to repeat the process ad infinitum (or until stimulated to switch behaviors)."
"Ant_Robot_4237_4333","Patrolling may be divided into two distinct sub-behaviors, nest patrolling and trail patrolling."
"Ant_Robot_4334_4601","An ant engaged in nest patrolling must exit the nest at the proper time in the morning and wander about for a bit on the nest mound, presumably taking measurements of the temperature and humidity in some way and making sure that it is safe for the other ants to exit."
"Ant_Robot_4602_4914","Perhaps the level of degradation of the nest patrollers’ cuticular hydrocarbons after this short foray into the sun and heat acts as an indication of the outside conditions to the foragers, who may then, upon smelling the returning patroller, be stimulated either to forage or to remain inactive inside the nest."
"Ant_Robot_4915_5103","An ant engaged in trail patrolling must exit the nest, wander around searching for food sources, identify food upon discovery and return to the nest to show the foragers where the food is."
"Ant_Robot_5104_5377","This is thought to be accomplished by the deposition of chemical markers from a gland on the abdomen that the patroller drags along the ground on her return route to the nest that the foragers may then follow (Gordon, 33-34; Holldobler et al, 1990, as cited in Webb, 1998)."
"Ant_Robot_5378_5513","In addition to following these trails to the food, foragers must also be able to identify food, grasp it and carry it back to the nest."
"Ant_Robot_5514_5795","Ants engaged in all three behaviors must be able to identify other nestmates and their current tasks (as well as indicate to other ants their own nestmate status and current task), walk, navigate both within and outside of the nest, and of course switch tasks at appropriate times."
"Ant_Robot_5821_5830","The Agent"
"Ant_Robot_5857_5864","Chassis"
"Ant_Robot_5877_5941","Antie will be implemented on a tiny Road Warrior robotic system."
"Ant_Robot_5942_6022","Behaviors will be coded in Interactive C, for which some pseudocode is included."
"Ant_Robot_6023_6148","Sensors will include a thermometer, photoreceptors, bump sensors, a polarization compass, and a series of chemical receptors."
"Ant_Robot_6149_6303","Antie be a circular robot, no more than 1cm in diameter (the length of a red harvester ant), with two driving wheels and one rear wheel for stabilization."
"Ant_Robot_6304_6390","A gripper will be located on the front of the robot consisting of two elongated tongs."
"Ant_Robot_6391_6614","Antie will also feature a skirt of bump sensors, sonar detectors and chemical emitters, including sacs of hydrocarbons extracted from ants of the nest being infiltrated and pheromones for successful patrolling and foraging."
"Ant_Robot_6615_6728","These sacs will be refilled at a filling station each morning as Antie determines that they are getting depleted."
"Ant_Robot_6729_6818","Antie will likewise recharge at a special station at night just inside the nest entrance."
"Ant_Robot_6819_6935","For the purposes of this proposal, I will assume that Antie has enough battery life to remain powered the whole day."
"Ant_Robot_6936_6981","A rudimentary blueprint of Antie is attached."
"Ant_Robot_7015_7022","Sensors"
"Ant_Robot_7035_7120","In order to inform itself about its environment, Antie will need a number of sensors."
"Ant_Robot_7121_7376","In an attempt to mimic the red harvester ant as closely as possible, these sensors include a thermometer, photoreceptors, bump sensors and sonar, a polarization compass, and a series of chemical receptors on a pair of stalks corresponding to the antennae."
"Ant_Robot_7377_7449","On its front grippers, Antie will have a tactile skin to sense pressure."
"Ant_Robot_7450_7523","The locations of the rest of these sensors will depend on their function."
"Ant_Robot_7536_7702","The thermometer will be located on the rear of the robot to keep it out of the way, and will detect and input to the robot the outside temperature in degrees Celsius."
"Ant_Robot_7703_7886","Harvester ants do not exit the nest when the outside temperature is above 52 degrees Celsius (Gordon, 9), and the ability to use a temperature gradient will enable in-nest navigation."
"Ant_Robot_7899_8030","Antie will also be equipped with one photoreceptor located in the middle of the top of its chassis corresponding to the ant’s eyes."
"Ant_Robot_8031_8256","These will be useful for initiating patrolling behavior in the morning and shutting off behaviors at night: the patrollers first poke their heads out of the nest shortly after sunrise and scuttle back in at night (Gordon, 5)."
"Ant_Robot_8269_8372","The bump sensors and sonar will form a skirt around Antie to keep it from colliding with other objects."
"Ant_Robot_8373_8595","The sonar will constantly be detecting nearby objects and initiate an escape maneuver when their inputs pass a certain threshold of stimulation, and the bump sensors will, when depressed, also initiate the escape function."
"Ant_Robot_8596_8740","The sonar will correspond to the ant’s limited optical object detection ability, and the bump sensors will allow the robot to detect collisions."
"Ant_Robot_8753_8959","The polarization compass will consist of two polarized light sensors placed at 45 and -45 degrees from the center front of Antie, respectively, that will orient Antie towards a desired polarization pattern."
"Ant_Robot_8960_9254","These sensors would correspond to the cells in the ants’ eyes sensitive to polarized light, and research has shown that many insects, including ants, do navigate using a path integration system synthesizing input from a polarization compasses and from a sort of odometer (Labhart, et al, 2002)."
"Ant_Robot_9255_9487","Antie would use a system for processing the input from its polarization compass based on the compass designed by Lambrinos, Moller, Labhart, Pfeifer and Wehner in 2000, consisting of two photodiodes with blue filters and polarizers."
"Ant_Robot_9496_9857","The difference of their logarithmized signals would be returned to Antie, who will use a simultaneous model to navigate returns to the nest: Upon each exit from the nest, Antie will take a single 360o scan of the sky, and will orient itself according to an analytical procedure to derive compass information from different polarization patterns perceived later."
"Ant_Robot_9858_10062","This should be sufficient to return Antie to the nest, given the accuracy achieved by Lambrinos, et al and the relatively short periods of time that harvester ants spend outside the nest before returning."
"Ant_Robot_10138_10217","Diagram of the polarization-opponent unit described by Lambrinos, et al (2000)."
"Ant_Robot_10218_10437","The unit takes in polarization levels through the two polarization-sensitive photodiodes and feeds them into the logarithm ratio amplifier, which returns the difference of the logarithmized signals from the photodiodes."
"Ant_Robot_10438_10549","The e-vector (heading) returned from the two polarization-sensitive photodiodes (1, 2) follows a cos2-function."
"Ant_Robot_10575_10869","Ants themselves rely primarily on chemical information taken in through their antennae, and to mimic this, Antie will have chemical sensing and emitting “stalks” with which to both interact with other ants (who may be surprised to find an ant without antennae) and take in chemical information."
"Ant_Robot_10870_11315","These stalks will need to have receptors to measure the n-alkene levels present in another ant’s cuticular hydrocarbons, which research indicates is the marker for harvester ants of a nestmate’s current task, perhaps because the hydrocarbons are altered in the dry sun, causing a different ratio of n-alkanes to n-alkenes and the presence of branched n-alkanes in the hydrocarbon profile (Wagner, et al, 2001, as cited in Gordon & Greene, 2003)."
"Ant_Robot_11316_11768","Antie’s stalks would also have receptors for the hydrocarbons themselves, which research shows indicate to the ants whether another ant is their nestmate (Arnold, et al, 1996, as cited in Gordon & Mehdiabadi, 1999), receptors to detect food, and receptors for three types of pheromones: those released by successful foragers returning with food, those released by successful patrollers returning to the nest, and those marking piles of trash as midden."
"Ant_Robot_11769_11942","Research shows that successful foragers returning to the nest do have a different effect on the inactive workers than unsuccessful foragers returning (Schafer, et al, 2006)."
"Ant_Robot_11943_12301","Returning successful patrollers have an even greater effect on foraging activity: foragers will not leave the nest unless a patroller returns (Gordon, 2002), and the rate of foraging in a colony can be controlled by rolling glass beads coated with cuticular hydrocarbons extracted from patrollers into the nest (Gordon & Greene, 2003; Greene & Gordon, 2007)."
"Ant_Robot_12302_12451","Midden seems to be marked in some olfactory way, since removing midden from nests makes them more likely to be invaded by other species (Gordon, 35)."
"Ant_Robot_12452_12603","For the purposes of this proposal, I will assume that the nest maintenance and food processing ants have marked the midden with a particular pheromone."
"Ant_Robot_12604_12740","All of these chemical receptors will be arranged in an array on a pair of chemical stalks, with four of each type of receptor per stalk."
"Ant_Robot_12741_12866","This technique, described by Ishida, et al (2001), has been shown to improve the chemical plume-tracking abilities of robots."
"Ant_Robot_12867_12934","The wires will lead back down through the stalk to the on-board PC."
"Ant_Robot_12947_13062","Finally, Antie will have tactile sensors on its grippers to analyze the pressure being exerted on a gripped object."
"Ant_Robot_13063_13316","These sensors will be of the type patented by Peterson, et al (Patent #4,492,949), and will feature several layers of electrically insulating and parallel flexible conductive rods arranged such that an exerted pressure may be measured in output voltage."
"Ant_Robot_13317_13447","These will correspond to the muscles of the ant’s mandibles, which provide sensorimotor feedback to the ant when grasping objects."
"Ant_Robot_13448_13536","A table of the sensors and their relation to the ant’s sensory system is provided below."
"Ant_Robot_13569_13617","Table of sensors and their relations to the ant."
"Ant_Robot_18145_18151","Motors"
"Ant_Robot_18164_18258","Antie’s motors will allow it to move around and interact with its environment and fellow ants."
"Ant_Robot_18259_18351","There will be two individually operated motors to drive the two side wheels in lieu of legs."
"Ant_Robot_18352_18473","Two simultaneously operated motors will open and close the grippers, emulating the grasping power of the ant’s mandibles."
"Ant_Robot_18474_18619","A third motor will lift and lower the grippers, allowing Antie to raise and lower gripped items as an ant would by raising and lowering its head."
"Ant_Robot_18620_18748","Three small sprayers will emit successful patroller and forager pheromones and cuticular hydrocarbons from the appropriate sacs."
"Ant_Robot_18749_19096","These will be located in different places: the sprayer for the successful patroller pheromone will be located on the rear at the base of Antie, corresponding to the glands that researchers believe the ants drag along behind them to mark returning paths, while the successful forager and cuticular hydrocarbon sprayers will be located on the skirt."
"Ant_Robot_19097_19290","Antie will not spray different pheromones depending on its task, on the assumption that its time in the sun will alter its hydrocarbons enough that its tasks will be recognizable to other ants."
"Ant_Robot_19291_19396","Almost all motor output will be a direct function of sensory input as indicated in the following section."
"Ant_Robot_19422_19434","The Behavior"
"Ant_Robot_19460_19639","Antie will have a hybrid software architecture: a subsumption hierarchy will be responsible for switching between behaviors, but many sub-behaviors will operate on a schema basis."
"Ant_Robot_19640_19796","Pseudocode will approximate this architecture as closely as possible, and where appropriate, different subroutines running on a schema basis will be marked."
"Ant_Robot_19822_19838","Common Behaviors"
"Ant_Robot_19851_19916","A few sub-behaviors will be necessary for more than one behavior."
"Ant_Robot_19917_20121","To ease Antie’s on-board memory requirements and processing capabilities (and to make all the rest of the pseudocode easier for the reader to understand), I propose a few global variables and subroutines."
"Ant_Robot_20134_20249","The following global variables will be used throughout the pseudocode, and are compiled here for ease of reference:"
"Ant_Robot_23162_23558","Common behaviors will include a forward cruise and turning mechanism, procedures to determine the orientation towards nest and the distance from the nest when outside, in-nest navigation, an escape function for when objects are detected or bumped into, object identification and gripping, a generic algorithm for pheromone plume and chemical trail following, and the identification of other ants."
"Ant_Robot_23571_23723","For a simple start, the forward cruise function will merely take in a double integer representing a speed and cause Antie to move forward at this speed."
"Ant_Robot_25547_25725","These behaviors will often be used in other subroutines running on a schema basis, and when combined with the forward cruise function, should cause the robot to move at an angle."
"Ant_Robot_25738_25959","In order to orient itself toward the nest while navigating outside, Antie will need to determine which direction the nest is in and rotate toward that heading, and also how far from the nest it is at its current location."
"Ant_Robot_25960_26089","The orientation and distance should be calculable by the polarization pattern according to the system set up by Lambrinos, et al."
"Ant_Robot_26090_26314","Antie will therefore have a polarization function that will return a compass direction toward which it should orient in order to return home to the nest, and a distance function that will return the shortest direct distance."
"Ant_Robot_26315_26479","We may assume that this first function will return a direction in degrees, positive or negative, and that the second function will return a distance in centimeters."
"Ant_Robot_26480_26530","The first function might look something like this:"
"Ant_Robot_27478_27583","In-nest navigation will be a function of the temperature, read by Antie’s thermometer and a light source."
"Ant_Robot_27584_27763","To exit, Antie will seek a high temperature until the photoreceptor reaches a threshold of stimulation indicating sunlight, and to get deeper, Antie will seek a lower temperature."
"Ant_Robot_27764_27802","The code may look something like this:"
"Ant_Robot_28506_28766","To enter the nest, such as at the end of a task, Antie will perform the same function, except it will seek a lower temperature instead of a higher temperature, it will avoid light, and it will only activate while Antie is less than 10cm from the nest entrance."
"Ant_Robot_28767_28841","This void function will be called nestEnter(), and will take in no inputs."
"Ant_Robot_28855_28950","To avoid bumping into things (including other ants), Antie be provided with an escape function."
"Ant_Robot_28951_29112","Each of Antie’s eight bump sensors will cause the robot to rotate a different amount, and the sonar will cause it to rotate 90 degrees in the opposite direction."
"Ant_Robot_29113_29161","Regardless, this will be a very simple function."
"Ant_Robot_29162_29189","I will include one example:"
"Ant_Robot_29941_30195","Because this function responds to the sensors on Antie’s around the sides and only its sonar detectors will be able to detect objects in front of it, this escape function will not prevent Antie from being able to locate and pick up objects such as seeds."
"Ant_Robot_30208_30277","Before picking objects up, however, Antie will need to identify them."
"Ant_Robot_30278_30411","This object detection process will be activated when the front bump sensor is stimulated or when both sonar detectors are stimulated."
"Ant_Robot_30412_30505","Chemical inputs will be checked to see what this object is most likely to be given its smell."
"Ant_Robot_30506_30543","Objects will include midden and food."
"Ant_Robot_30544_30582","The code may look something like this:"
"Ant_Robot_31867_31934","Once the object has been identified, Antie may grip it and lift it."
"Ant_Robot_31935_32117","A simple void function grip() taking in no inputs will tighten the grippers until a certain threshold of pressure is reached, at which point the grippers will be lifted for carrying."
"Ant_Robot_32118_32185","A void function release() will perform this same action in reverse."
"Ant_Robot_32198_32401","Antie will also need to follow several different kinds of chemical gradient trails: it will need to track the trails left by successful patrollers, and localize the source of food-odors and midden-odors."
"Ant_Robot_32402_32667","Implementations of chemical gradient following robots using two sensors on “antennae” stalks has been successful in with analog robots in the past (Webb, 1998), regardless of the potential problem of airflow causing a disturbed gradient over evaporating pheromones."
"Ant_Robot_32668_32838","As a partial control for the problem of imprecise sensing, a function will perform an analysis of the array information coming on from Antie’s four sensors on each stalk."
"Ant_Robot_32839_32949","The differences between these outputs is what is being compared everywhere there is a “left_IP” or “right_IP.”"
"Ant_Robot_32950_33250","Antie will use the chemical gradient algorithm of Braitenberg’s aggressive type 2 vehicle described in his book “Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology,” as this was found through a series of experiments by Russell, et al (2003) to be very efficient when compared to several biomimetic models."
"Ant_Robot_33251_33412","Because the same general algorithm will be followed for the localization of all three chemical traces, I will provide pseudocode for only one generic subroutine."
"Ant_Robot_33413_33479","Note that a portion of this subroutine does run on a schema basis:"
"Ant_Robot_34197_34329","For the purposes of calls later in the pseudocode, I will refer to these subroutines as trailFollow(), findFood(), and findMidden()."
"Ant_Robot_34330_34368","All three are void and take no inputs."
"Ant_Robot_34381_34458","The final common subroutine will be one for the identification of other ants."
"Ant_Robot_34459_34606","When both sonar sensors are stimulated simultaneously, Antie will check hydrocarbon inputs and determine whether the detected object is a nestmate."
"Ant_Robot_34607_34748","As harvester ants tend not to engage aggressively with non-nestmates, Antie will only identify other ants as ants if they belong to its nest."
"Ant_Robot_34749_34957","Research has shown that red harvester ants may identify the tasks nestmates are engaged in based on the ratio of n-alkenes to n-alkanes in their hydrocarbons and the presence or absence of branched n-alkanes."
"Ant_Robot_34958_35072","The difference in ratio is caused by the time ants spend outside in the sun, which depletes their n-alkene levels."
"Ant_Robot_35073_35165","Antie will attempt to determine the tasks of other ants by sensing only the n-alkene levels."
"Ant_Robot_35166_35264","The code will be similar to the object identification subroutine and may look something like this:"
"Ant_Robot_36254_36326","Using these basic common behaviors, more complex behaviors may be coded."
"Ant_Robot_36339_36491","Red harvester ants do not retain one task throughout their lifespan, but instead change their behaviors as is appropriate for the colony (Gordon, 1996)."
"Ant_Robot_36492_36733","Research has shown that red harvester ants switch tasks partially as a function of age (ex., Ingram, et al, 2005) and partially as a function of interactions with other workers (ex., Schafer et al, 2006; Gordon, 2002; Greene & Gordon, 2007)."
"Ant_Robot_36734_36816","Younger ants work more inside the nest, and older ants work more outside the nest."
"Ant_Robot_36817_36912","As a result, I will model the three main behaviors in the order that they are to be engaged in."
"Ant_Robot_36913_37156","Midden work, which consists of moving dirt between the inside of the nest and the outside, will occur first; patrolling, which involves a shorter overall amount of time spent outside, will occur second; and foraging will be the final behavior."
"Ant_Robot_37157_37247","Finally, I will discuss a main method encoding the task switching between these behaviors."
"Ant_Robot_37260_37326","The midden work behavior will be Antie’s default initial behavior."
"Ant_Robot_37327_37506","It will be initiated in the morning by the sunrise, and will continue until the outside temperature reaches 52­­­oC, at which point all red harvester ants must return to the nest."
"Ant_Robot_37507_37683","As previously stated, a midden worker must identify midden, grasp it, and carry it to the surface, depositing it halfway down the mound before returning to collect more midden."
"Ant_Robot_37684_37738","A program encoding this behavior might look like this:"
"Ant_Robot_38994_39092","The second behavior, patrolling, involves two sub-behaviors: nest patrolling and trail patrolling."
"Ant_Robot_39093_39216","Nest patrolling will involve leaving the nest, roaming around on the nest mound for a few minutes, and reentering the nest."
"Ant_Robot_39217_39310","This behavior will be implemented in two parts, with a task-switching algorithm based on age."
"Ant_Robot_39311_39565","Research shows that ants do change their behaviors based partly on their perceived life expectancy (Moron, et al, 2007), and that task-switching is partly genetically controlled by a switch in gene expression as the individual ages (Ingram, et al, 2005)."
"Ant_Robot_39566_39686","It is therefore reasonable to assign a constant age at which Antie will switch from nest patrolling to trail patrolling."
"Ant_Robot_39687_39828","In order to perform both of these functions, Antie will need a subroutine to explore in a zig-zag fashion, as harvester ants do (Gordon, 34)."
"Ant_Robot_39829_39995","Harvester ants display a preference to wander in familiar territory, though foragers and patrollers do sometimes wander into other nests’ territories (Gordon, 57-60)."
"Ant_Robot_39996_40158","To control for this behavior, Antie’s explore subroutine will display a preference for exploration in places where there is a low gradient of nestmate pheromones."
"Ant_Robot_40159_40337","This model is reasonable because patrollers and foragers change their explored territory from day to day, even though they do retain some more commonly chosen paths (Gordon, 45)."
"Ant_Robot_40338_40376","The code may look something like this:"
"Ant_Robot_43115_43251","Nest patrollers will only call this behavior for a short distance before returning to the nest to idle for a few minutes and exit again."
"Ant_Robot_43252_43404","Trail patrollers will go much further, until food sources are found, and will then orient towards the nest and create trails for the foragers to follow."
"Ant_Robot_43405_43517","A general site of food is all that the patroller need find; the foragers will dig through the sand for the food."
"Ant_Robot_43518_43610","Code for the patrolling behavior might look like this (note that part is on a schema basis):"
"Ant_Robot_45828_46012","For the task-switching in the patrolling behavior, assume some variable “age” that Antie has been keeping track of using the CPU’s clock pulses to track the time since its last bootup."
"Ant_Robot_46013_46137","The integers nestpatrol_age and trailpatrol_age will represent the ages at which it is appropriate to switch to these tasks."
"Ant_Robot_46529_46637","The final behavior, foraging, will involve one extra subroutine that will employ an algorithm designed by R."
"Ant_Robot_46638_46714","Andrew Russell to localize an object through sand based on a chemical plume."
"Ant_Robot_46715_46868","This will emulate the digging that foragers must often do in order to locate seeds, and will enable Antie to accurately retrieve seeds for its host nest."
"Ant_Robot_46869_46975","This algorithm will keep track of the last two intensities of the desired chemical input and compare them."
"Ant_Robot_46976_47065","It would also keep track of whether the last rotation was clockwise or counter-clockwise."
"Ant_Robot_47066_47136","The code for this, adapted from Russell’s paper, might look like this:"
"Ant_Robot_47971_48163","Foragers will follow trails marked by patrollers to their conclusion before collecting food to bring back to the nest, even if more tantalizing food presents itself in their path (Gordon, 47)."
"Ant_Robot_48164_48282","To address this, a strict subsumption hierarchy will make sure that the foragers do not stop to collect food too soon."
"Ant_Robot_48283_48313","The code might look like this:"
"Ant_Robot_50069_50170","Of course, what makes Antie an innovative robot is the task-switching between these larger behaviors."
"Ant_Robot_50171_50290","Because the midden work behavior is Antie’s initial default behavior, I will not address task switching to midden work."
"Ant_Robot_50291_50564","Workers probably switch to patrolling based on their perceived life expectancy and as a function of a gene whose expression changes between young and old ants, and this is easily emulated using a clock pulse counter in Antie’s CPU that will count its “age” since last boot."
"Ant_Robot_50565_50725","To remind the reader, this technique was implemented earlier in this proposal to create the limited task-switching between nest patrolling and trail patrolling."
"Ant_Robot_50726_51096","The switch from patrolling to foraging has been modeled as a function of successful foragers’ returns with great accuracy by Schafer, et al (2006), and evidence from experiments in which successful foragers were removed before reentry to the nest does support the theory that returning successful foragers have an effect on the activation of new foragers (Gordon, 2002)."
"Ant_Robot_51097_51172","Activated foragers form a queue to exit the nest and exit at a steady rate."
"Ant_Robot_51173_51388","According to Schafer’s, et al. model of forager activation, every time a successful forager returns and no foragers are currently in line to exit, a fraction (modeled at 0.0035) of inactive foragers joins the queue."
"Ant_Robot_51389_51606","For the purposes of modeling Antie, I will assume that the switches between these behaviors are permanent, irreversible and partly a function of age, with new foragers being activated by returning successful foragers."
"Ant_Robot_51607_51676","The code to model this task-switching might look something like this:"
"Ant_Robot_53560_53570","Conclusion"
"Ant_Robot_53596_53976","Antie will be a fully autonomous, situated and embodied agent, infiltrating a red harvester ant colony and providing valuable information not only about the hypothesized rules of these ants’ behaviors and their task-switching thresholds, but also about the combination of complex behaviors into a single autonomous system with the ability to switch between behaviors as necessary."
"Ant_Robot_53977_54388","Biomimetic robots have long been a rich source of information for both biologists and robotics engineers, and complex robots that can switch tasks as the situation demands and communicate information about current tasks could be useful for further studies of complex robot behaviors as well as for the obvious practical applications of robot swarms, such as on the battlefield and standard building maintenance."

"anth_essay_4_252_389","Humans, in the process of defining themselves, look to immediately recognizable factors in order to differentiate themselves from others."
"anth_essay_4_390_660","This process leads to the development of what can be broadly termed culture: a group of people joined by characteristics, traits, and beliefs comes to view themselves as sharing a distinct identity, discernible from that of those “outside” them, those who do not belong."
"anth_essay_4_661_752","Naturally this can be signaled by any number of things - clothing, food, lifestyle choices."
"anth_essay_4_753_815","One of the most dominant and easily noted factors is language."
"anth_essay_4_816_949","The command of a language, while not affording guaranteed access to the community which speaks it, is often the key to gaining entry."
"anth_essay_4_950_1070","In turn communal identity can be formed around a language; it is used as the focal point around which the group gathers."
"anth_essay_4_1071_1305","Therefore when considering the indigenous revitalization movements which began in 20th century Latin America, the impact of those indigenous languages on those movements and the nature of the identity of the peoples themselves is key."
"anth_essay_4_1306_1704","Language plays a complex and integral role in the development and redefinition of an identity, particularly when that identity has been oppressed and subsumed by a dominant other for as long as that of the indigenous peoples in Latin America has. In particular I will examine two divergent yet remarkably parallel cases, that of the Maya in Guatemala and the Nasa and Guambiano peoples of Colombia."
"anth_essay_4_1705_1964","Their struggle to attain status in societies still bearing the marks of Spanish colonialism is deeply tied to their struggle to reaffirm the nature of their “indigenous identity”, and is in turn linked to the interaction of Spanish and their native languages."
"anth_essay_4_1977_2072","The effects of Spanish colonialism are both far-reaching and deeply embedded in both countries."
"anth_essay_4_2073_2323","One of the most prominent, lasting influences is that of the land grant system. Initially the Spanish government attempted to instate the encomienda system, in which a conquistador maintained direct control over the indigenous peoples and their land."
"anth_essay_4_2324_2540","This was in turn replaced by the repartimento; the natives were allowed to maintain control over their land and their laws but remained in every way the inferior of the Spanish, providing labor and taxes as demanded."
"anth_essay_4_2541_2819","In reality land ownership rights were the exclusive right of the Spanish, resulting in modern-day malappropriation of land ownership in the hands of the descendants of the Spanish colonialists (Warren 1978, 7-8). Indigenous peoples are commonly sharecroppers or migrant workers."
"anth_essay_4_2820_2942","The impoverished plight of the native populations was first recognized by the Marxist movements of the early 20th century."
"anth_essay_4_2943_3178","Those were the first to articulate the necessity of affirming the independent identity of the indigenous populations; previously, both the left and right maintained a belief in indigenous assimilation into the dominant Spanish culture."
"anth_essay_4_3179_3273","The Marxists, on the contrary, argued that the indigenous peoples possessed a unique identity."
"anth_essay_4_3274_3559","However, they also claimed that they were part of a larger group, the working class, whose poverty was a direct result of American imperialism; therefore they should join these new popular leftist movements in order to reorganize society into a worker-friendly one (Jackson 1995: 6-7)."
"anth_essay_4_3573_3679","In Colombia this resulted in a civil war between the Liberal and Communist parties and Conservative party."
"anth_essay_4_3680_3837","A truce established between the Liberals and Conservatives failed to meet the demands of the Communists, who in turn sustained guerrilla attacks in response."
"anth_essay_4_3838_4054","Guerrilla warfare has since become a part of Colombian life; multiple groups maintain an ongoing presence, often stationing themselves in the remote mountainous villages often populated by various indigenous peoples."
"anth_essay_4_4055_4297","This is similar to the situation of Guatemala: the government felt it needed to battle communism, an “armed and dangerous menace within”, plunging the country into civil warfare in the 1960s and continuing through the 1980s (Warren 1993: 25)."
"anth_essay_4_4298_4596","This resulted in persecution against the Mayans, who make up about 60% of the overall population. In both counties, guerrillas were often associated with the native peoples; in many cases there were coalitions, but in others the guerrillas merely used the remote, inaccessible villages as hideouts."
"anth_essay_4_4597_4711","In Guatemala over 450 villages were destroyed, 200,000 Mayans were killed, and over 1 million more were displaced."
"anth_essay_4_4712_4827","The main guerrilla force was demilitarized in 1996 with the establishment of a peace accord (Warren 2002: 157-158)."
"anth_essay_4_4840_4994","The growth in popularity and militarism of these popular leftist movements is intertwined with the development of the indigenous revitalization movements."
"anth_essay_4_4995_5152","By the 1970s the need to assert a cause separate from the general left was seen, and indigenous rights movements formed (Warren 2003: 174, Jackson 2002: 82)."
"anth_essay_4_5153_5210","Central to these was the question of indigenous identity:"
"anth_essay_4_5211_5383","largely lost amidst the overwhelming Spanish influence, local leaders sought to rediscover their native roots and redefine what it meant to be a part of indigenous culture."
"anth_essay_4_5384_5572","Pan-Mayanism in particular has sought to organize itself around the Mayan language; despite local dialectical differences, it is seen as the unifying force behind the diverse Mayan people."
"anth_essay_4_5573_5744","Most still speak it in various forms, and efforts by Mayan linguists to standardize the language are producing a coherent, modern version of Maya (England 2003: 733, 739)."
"anth_essay_4_5745_5966","Pan-Mayanism has succeeded in part due to its focus on issues of ethnicity; it largely avoids specifically political overtones, instead concentrating on the development of the reemerging Mayan culture (England 2003: 734)."
"anth_essay_4_5967_6070","The popular left, however, continues to see the rhetoric of ethnic rights as a politically viable tool."
"anth_essay_4_6071_6152","It therefore often invokes the banner of indigenous rights in its own discourse ."
"anth_essay_4_6153_6384","The Pan-Mayan movement thus benefits from the lasting influence of the popular left on Guatemalan governmental policies without risking drawing the (often negative) attention of the government (England 2003: 735, Warren 2003: 181)."
"anth_essay_4_6385_6632","A main concern among pan-Mayanists is the reversal of the long-seated inferiority complex of the Mayan people; despite their position as majority within the Guatemalan population, they remain impoverished and marginalized on the fridge of society."
"anth_essay_4_6633_6825","This results in part from the ingrained influences of Spanish colonialism: Spanish continues to be associated with modernity and social mobility, whereas Maya is seen as backward and inferior."
"anth_essay_4_6826_6980","Pan-Mayan leaders therefore seek to develop a return to Maya as it was in its classical renaissance, a language of power and prestige (England 2003: 736)."
"anth_essay_4_6981_7125","By doing so they hope to inculcate among the Mayan peoples a renewed sense of pride which will in turn reverse the dogma of Spanish superiority."
"anth_essay_4_7138_7324","Colombia, in contrast, has no unified ""pan-Indian"" sentiments; the indigenous population is a small fraction of the overall population, a fractured entity divided by region and language."
"anth_essay_4_7325_7555","Several competing and oftentimes conflicting indigenous rights advocacy groups have developed: the ONIC poses itself as the sole pan-Indian group, yet lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many indigenous peoples (Jackson 2002: 83, 85)."
"anth_essay_4_7556_7684","The CRIC, which focuses on language development and renewal, is primarily representative of the Nasa peoples (Jackson 2003: 82)."
"anth_essay_4_7685_7776","It often stands in conflict with the AICO, its Guambiano counterpart (Jackson 2003: 83-84)."
"anth_essay_4_7777_7950","Whereas the Mayanists benefit from a single main identity, those of Colombia must operate under historical differences between the various ethnic groups (Jackson 2002: 109)."
"anth_essay_4_7951_8120","The Nasa and Guambiano have stood in opposition since pre-colonial times; therefore any coalition between the two advocacy groups is tenuous at best (Rappaport 2005: 2)."
"anth_essay_4_8121_8271","This reflects a desire among the peoples themselves to maintain distinct ethnic identities, both from the Spanish Colombian population and each other."
"anth_essay_4_8272_8608","In the 1990s the rhetoric of ""cultural diversity"" was picked up the Colombian media, and subsequently entered the consciousness of the greater metropolitan public, thereby cementing its place in Colombian society as necessity and further complicating the role of indigenous movements in gaining rights for indigenous peoples as a whole."
"anth_essay_4_8621_8850","A major success in the Colombian saga is the revamped constitution of 1991, which includes a section on indigenous rights, as the Congress which drafted it included representatives from native groups (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 57)."
"anth_essay_4_8851_8984","Central is a return to the old land grant system stemming from the repartimentos of the colonial era along with judicial sovereignty."
"anth_essay_4_8985_9168","While the repartimento was originally used to repress the indigenous groups, it is now used to support them: resguardos, or communally owned plots of land, are granted to communities."
"anth_essay_4_9169_9283","They are ruled by the cabildo, local governing boards formed of community leaders (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 51-52)."
"anth_essay_4_9284_9364","The return to customary law reflects a substantial shift in indigenous identity:"
"anth_essay_4_9365_9515","no longer ruled by Western laws and discourse, communities are forced to assess the efficacy of their old judicial systems in light of the modern era."
"anth_essay_4_9516_9755","The oral nature of jurisprudence directly conflicts with the desire of the Colombian government to codify law, and questions of human rights violations are common as punishments are often corporal in nature (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 57-58)."
"anth_essay_4_9768_9890","The Colombian constitution stands in stark contrast to the failure of the Guatemalan indigenous rights referendum of 1999."
"anth_essay_4_9891_10154","Mayans gained formal recognition in 1995 as the majority population in a precursor to the 1996 peace accord; by 1999 its government floated a referendum on an indigenous bill of rights resembling that codified in the Colombian constitution (Warren 2002: 157-158)."
"anth_essay_4_10155_10348","It failed, despite the Mayan majority; possible reasons include the overwhelming illiteracy rates among the indigenous population and inaccessibility of voting stations (Warren 2002: 149, 151)."
"anth_essay_4_10349_10685","However, it reflects on a greater level both the desire of many Mayans to assimilate, as they still feel that is necessary for social mobility, and a belief among the general population that Mayans do not require a separate bill of rights as they are covered under the general rights already in the constitution (Warren 2002: 159, 172)."
"anth_essay_4_10686_10866","Illiteracy rates are in fact correlated with the Mayan language itself: those who speak Spanish are more likely to be literate than those who speak Mayan alone (England 2003: 733)."
"anth_essay_4_10867_11117","Nonetheless, in 2003 the legislature passed the law of national languages, which while reaffirming Spanish as the official language, recognizes the importance of indigenous languages as part of national identity and encourages their active promotion."
"anth_essay_4_11118_11247","While largely symbolic, it is still significant in that Guatemalan identity is seen as encompassing languages other than Spanish."
"anth_essay_4_11260_11357","This question of identity as defined by language manifests differently in Guatemala and Colombia."
"anth_essay_4_11358_11677","Within the pan-Mayan movement, there remains a desire to maintain linguistic diversity: some view the reduction of their language to the status of ""dialect"" devalues their unique identity and place in the Mayan world; however, despite differences over standardization, the pan-Mayan movement itself is largely cohesive."
"anth_essay_4_11678_11876","In contrast, Colombian indigenous groups are divided to the extent that linguistic diversity is not only valued, but serves to split the population, both between groups and within groups themselves."
"anth_essay_4_11877_12104","An example is the Tukanoans: while considered a single “ethnic group”, they maintain 16 distinct language groups and practice linguistic exogamy, in which members of one language group must marry into another (Jackson 1995: 4)."
"anth_essay_4_12118_12251","Language further works to establish identity by encapsulating a worldview markedly removed from that of the dominant Western culture."
"anth_essay_4_12252_12588","Indigenous cosmology, or “cosmovision”, is difficult to translate into Romanticized languages; it maintains a concept of culture, defined as “the form of behavior resulting from a permanent harmonic relationship with Nature” (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 58) and view of history as cyclic that is often at odds with Western modes of thought."
"anth_essay_4_12589_12789","Conflict between cultures arise as cosmovision is rediscovered and developed, often by native shamans in tandem with indigenous leaders aided by outside researchers and non-governmental organizations."
"anth_essay_4_12790_12996","The differences between Western and native perceptions then lead to conflict within the revitalization movements themselves: the question of embracing Western law and discourse is continually grappled with."
"anth_essay_4_12997_13196","It is necessary to work within the national legal system in order to gain policy reform beyond the local level; however, with widely differing concepts of justice a a balance is difficult to achieve."
"anth_essay_4_13197_13539","Customary law in Colombia contrasts with Western law as it maintains a different perception of casual relationships: tying back to the indigenous concept of harmony, crimes are viewed as imbalances in the community's harmony and can often be traced back to those who did not perpetuate the crime, but may have influenced the accused to do so."
"anth_essay_4_13540_13653","When a punishment - often public and corporal in nature - is carried out, the group feels the effects as a whole."
"anth_essay_4_13654_13740","Shamans often sit with the criminal as he fills his sentence, sharing in their ordeal."
"anth_essay_4_13741_13971","(Rappaport 2005) Once punishments are completed, the criminal is seen as rehabilitated, having fulfilled his duty to restore harmonic order, and is welcomed back into the community (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 61, Rappaport 2005: 97)."
"anth_essay_4_13984_14126","Translation of law into native languages has proved to be a difficult task, as Western ideas often have no parallel in indigenous cosmovision."
"anth_essay_4_14127_14407","The translation of the Colombian constitution sparked the development of neologisms, as the goal of the translators was not to provide a direct translation of the constitution, but to recapture its spirit in a native, rather than Western discourse (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 58-59)."
"anth_essay_4_14408_14633","This provides a second interpretation of law distinct from that of the Spanish Colombian culture, and in turn an interpretation aligned with native ideology for the cabildos to follow when governing (Rappaport 2005: 93, 236)."
"anth_essay_4_14634_14746","Translation fulfills another vital role, as it is employed in the rediscovery of the indigenous identity itself."
"anth_essay_4_14747_14949","Workshops and advocacy groups regularly work to translate native histories back into native forms of knowledge, distancing them from the Western influences that have invaded over the past six centuries."
"anth_essay_4_14950_15202","The Guambiano history project charts native history as the outward spiraling events which are both cyclic and parallel in nature; Mayan historians translate and document oral histories whose legacy is in danger of being forgotten (Rappaport 2005: 165)."

"Bartok_34_97","Tonal Structure and Form in Bartók’s Concerto for Orchestra (I)"
"Bartok_174_297","Before beginning an analysis of any piece by Béla Bartók, one must first decide to what degree tonal analysis will be used."
"Bartok_298_431","Bartók’s music, although it is often difficult to call completely tonal, never entirely sheds itself of tonal elements and structure."
"Bartok_432_561","This remains true even with one of his last compositions, the Concerto for Orchestra, written two years before his death in 1943."
"Bartok_562_700","The discussion that follows analyzes the first movement of the Concerto, focusing on the tonal structures at play throughout the movement."
"Bartok_701_836","The analysis will treat the movement tonally, investigating the progression of local “tonics” and its relationship to the overall form."
"Bartok_837_1047","We will also examine to what degree a “tonal” reading of this movement is limited in its analytical potential in an attempt to pinpoint exactly where Bartók strays from common-practice compositional techniques."
"Bartok_1060_1087","Harmonic Structure and Form"
"Bartok_1100_1186","Bartók describes the form of the first movement as “more or less regular sonata form.”"
"Bartok_1234_1563","While that does not seem to be a meaningful assertion, it is perfectly accurate: the movement is in sonata form, but there is an introduction that does not relate thematically to any other parts of the movement (not unheard of in Mozart sonatas), and the recapitulation presents the two themes of the exposition in reverse order."
"Bartok_1564_1683","The “backwards” recapitulation is a technique that Bartók employs frequently because of the formal symmetry it creates."
"Bartok_1702_1740","For example, the fifth string quartet."
"Bartok_1741_1790","Also see Bartók’s comments on that (Bartók, 414)."
"Bartok_1807_1940","Example 1 shows a diagram of the form of the movement; the symmetry is apparent within the seven sections following the introduction."
"Bartok_1941_2189","As the example shows, the development section is divided into three subsections; the first and third subsections draw their thematic material from the first theme group, and the second subsection involves new material not drawn from the exposition."
"Bartok_2190_2369","Hence, on either side of the middle section of the development we have the alternation FTG-STG-FTG which makes the overall form, with the exception of the Introduction, symmetric."
"Bartok_2388_2504","Paul Wilson also discusses the inherent symmetry of the movement, although his interpretation is somewhat different."
"Bartok_2505_2525","See Wilson, 168-170."
"Bartok_2666_2761","The abbreviations FTG and STG stand for First Theme Group and Second Theme Group, respectively."
"Bartok_2865_2956","Sonata form—or, “more-or-less” sonata form—carries harmonic as well as formal connotations."
"Bartok_2957_3173","While “tonality” in this piece (and in Bartók’s music in general) is quite different from its classical interpretation, we find that the harmonic structure is at least analogous to the standard sonata-form structure."
"Bartok_3174_3210","To begin with, the movement is in F."
"Bartok_3211_3488","When we say “in F,” we do not imply F major (or minor, for that matter)—the major/minor tonal system in general does not apply to this piece—but rather that the pitch-class F is the tonal center of the movement, and acts analogously to the tonic in a Mozartian sonata movement."
"Bartok_3489_3616","Using this interpretation, we can map out the local tonics (tonal centers) used throughout the movement, as shown in Example 2."
"Bartok_3735_3949","In this example, the barlines divide the formal sections of the piece (Introduction–Exposition–Development­–Recapitulation)—so we can immediately see that the tonic F is not established until the exposition begins."
"Bartok_3950_4223","Beginning with the exposition, the large-scale progression of tonal centers is a whole-tone descent from F to F, represented by the stemmed notes in Example 2, while the Introduction ascends from C♯ to F through D♯ (shown as D♭ and E♭ in the graph) in a quasi-bass Anstieg."
"Bartok_4224_4413","The middle pitch of the descent, B, acts as the “dominant” to F, based on its symmetrical division of the whole-tone scale and the fact that the second theme appears in B in the exposition."
"Bartok_4414_4598","Bartók has often applied a tonic-dominant relationship to a pitch-class and its tritone partner, and even admits to using that as a compositional framework in his fifth string quartet."
"Bartok_4617_4637","See Bartók, 414-415."
"Bartok_4654_4911","In this particular movement, Bartók feigns moving to the tonal dominant, C, for the second theme before reinterpreting C as a chromatic passing tone between D♭ and B—this and other subtleties shown in Example 2 will be explained in detail in later sections."
"Bartok_4966_5131","Paul Wilson gives a detailed account of the foreground activity throughout this movement in his analysis; we do not seek to duplicate or substitute for his findings."
"Bartok_5132_5240","Our analysis will focus instead on relating the foreground activity to the overarching background structure."
"Bartok_5241_5522","The graph in Example 2 will serve as a point of departure for the subsequent analysis; while we will periodically refer back to some of its specific elements, it should be understood that even when not explicitly referenced, this graph serves as the explanatory goal of this paper."
"Bartok_5535_5551","The Introduction"
"Bartok_5564_5694","As Paul Wilson points out, the title “Introduzione” given to the movement as a whole seems to apply only to the first 75 measures."
"Bartok_5742_6025","The Introduction does not relate thematically to any of the main sections of the movement—in fact, it is the third movement that draws its thematic material from this section—but the harmonic and motivic principles at play here foreshadow some important elements of the entire piece."
"Bartok_6026_6176","To begin with, the opening motive in the celli and basses, shown in Example 3, outlines a pentatonic set and strongly presents C♯ as the tonal center."
"Bartok_6177_6348","The pentatonic set here is exclusively a pitch-class set, and its incarnations throughout the movement are devoid of any connotations associated with the pentatonic scale."
"Bartok_6349_6459","Indeed, this set can be seen more as a by-product of stacked perfect fourths than a generative element itself."
"Bartok_6460_6654","The perfect fourth in fact generates much of the motivic and harmonic material of the entire movement, and its importance is immediately evident in the Introduction with the opening bass motive."
"Bartok_6655_6874","Furthermore, the following two instances of this opening motive, shown in Examples 4 and 5, remove any doubt as to the motivic importance of the perfect fourth, and in turn diminish the importance of the pentatonic set."
"Bartok_7190_7329","Example 4 transitions from C♯ to F♯, and adds pitch-class E to the pentatonic set of Example 3, creating a six-note set of stacked fourths."
"Bartok_7330_7450","Example 5 shows the true dominance of the perfect fourth; the set created is a ten-note set derived by stacking fourths."
"Bartok_7469_7600","If we begin from the final D♯ and ascend the circle of fourths until we reach C we obtain the entire set presented in this example."
"Bartok_7617_7722","Each note is either approached or left (or both) by a fourth, and the structural motion is from F♯ to D♯."
"Bartok_7723_7859","The overall motion in the first 29 measures is C♯ to D♯, through F♯; these are represented enharmonically in Example 2 as D♭, E♭ and G♭."
"Bartok_7860_7988","As previously mentioned, this motion constitutes the initial ascent to what will eventually be a whole-tone descent from F to F."
"Bartok_7989_8153","So the prevailing structural motion of the movement as a whole is a descending whole step and the prevailing melodic motion is a (usually ascending) perfect fourth."
"Bartok_8154_8344","We can connect the two by noting that the descending whole step consists of two ascending fourths; indeed, the structural whole-tone descent is often “filled in” with the intervening fourth."
"Bartok_8345_8415","This motion is exemplified in Example 2 in the second theme group (mm."
"Bartok_8416_8559","155-233), and as we will see, it occurs in other places, though not relevant enough to the background structure to be represented in Example 2."
"Bartok_8573_8840","Each time the motion in Examples 3 through 5 breaks from chains of fourths, the same sequence of intervals occurs: two descending perfect fourths separated by an ascending major second (-5, +2, -5); each instance of this intervallic cell is bracketed in the examples."
"Bartok_8841_8999","This sequence of intervals is the inversion of those found in the second head motive of the first theme of the exposition, shown in measures 2-3 of Example 8."
"Bartok_9000_9234","So although there is no thematic relation between the Introduction and the main sections of the movement, within the first 29 measures we can already see structural, harmonic and motivic elements that apply to the movement as a whole."
"Bartok_9247_9408","The section from measures 35-50 is centered on E; upon the return of D♯, enharmonically respelled as E♭, in measure 58, we see that E acts as its upper-neighbor."
"Bartok_9409_9632","This relationship is somewhat obscured by measures 51-57 however; while there is no clear tonal center for this section, G appears in the outer voices in measure 51, although the harmonic material is reminiscent of C minor."
"Bartok_9633_9768","The concluding motive of this section in the violins (the bracketed sections of Example 6), as well as the bass motive of measure 58ff."
"Bartok_9769_9888","(Example 7), are related to the first head motive of the first theme, which is shown in the first measure of Example 8."
"Bartok_9889_9999","All three of these motives span a tritone, which as mentioned is the “dominant” relationship in this movement."
"Bartok_10000_10121","Paul Wilson describes the transition from the Introduction to the Exposition as “quite abrupt and seemingly unmotivated,”"
"Bartok_10140_10152","Wilson, 173."
"Bartok_10169_10276","but it is in fact this motivic relationship that ties them together and creates a rather smooth transition."
"Bartok_10509_10523","The Exposition"
"Bartok_10536_10720","Although the motivic relationship between the Introduction and the first theme of the exposition smooth the transition, nearly every other element changes when the first theme appears."
"Bartok_10721_10876","The drastic tempo and meter changes as well as the first appearances of staccato articulations make it clear to the listener that the introduction is over."
"Bartok_10877_11177","As mentioned, the first theme, the beginning of which is reproduced in Example 8, contains two head motives: the first is the tritone-spanning ascent that appears in the first measure, and the second is an iteration of the interval cell (+5, -2, +5) that appears in the second through third measures."
"Bartok_11178_11349","While the presence of the perfect fourths that was so prevalent in the Introduction is clear in the latter, the former does not employ the perfect fourth in its formation."
"Bartok_11350_11542","Rather, this motive is a small-scale representation of the tonic-dominant relationship of tritone partners, specifically F and B, that is the basis for the harmonic structure of this movement."
"Bartok_11645_11802","Rhythmically, we have a dissonance between the melody, which follows the written meter, and the accompanying chords in the bassoons, horns and lower strings."
"Bartok_11803_11928","Example 9 reproduces the chords, and Example 10 rewrites them in a meter that is more consistent with their rhythmic pattern."
"Bartok_11929_12054","As Example 10 shows, the chords are more-or-less in duple meter (4/8 and 2/8) with one “hiccup” occurring in the 5/8 measure."
"Bartok_12055_12190","This is in strict metric dissonance with the triple meter of the melody (with its own “hiccups” occurring in the written 2/8 measures)."
"Bartok_12191_12286","As we will later see, this dissonance disappears when this theme returns in the recapitulation."
"Bartok_12539_12727","We have already mentioned that the first theme group is in F—this is made clear from the onset, both in the melodic line and by the F minor triad that occurs on the downbeat of measure 77."
"Bartok_12728_12855","While the material occasionally departs from this F in measures 76-94, these departures are all subordinate to the prolonged F."
"Bartok_12856_12968","E♭ is the tonal center for measures 95-134, although it does not appear as a strong bass note until measure 131."
"Bartok_12969_13097","Measures 95-130 contain a mostly chromatic descent from C to E♭, where E♭ is anticipated throughout as a goal tone for the bass."
"Bartok_13098_13136","Example 11 illustrates this structure."
"Bartok_13137_13278","Immediately following the arrival of E♭ in the bass, C♯ (D♭) is established as the tonal center for the final transition to the second theme."
"Bartok_13279_13451","The trombone motive in measures 134-141, shown in Example 12, is the subject of the fugato section in part 3 of the development, although its importance is downplayed here."
"Bartok_13452_13591","Note that the initial G♯ is a pickup to the section in C♯, which fills in the whole-tone descent from E♭ to C♯ with the intervening fourth."
"Bartok_13592_13815","This motive also contains the intervallic cell of the second head motive of the first theme in the form of G♯-C♯-B-E (with the addition of some passing tones), in addition to consisting largely of motion by perfect fourths."
"Bartok_14045_14140","Wilson claims that C and E♭ are “local dominants” to F in this first section of the exposition."
"Bartok_14188_14379","While the strong V-I motion from measures 90-91 does carry a tonal implication of dominant-tonic, such cadential bass motion does not imply anything about structural function in this context."
"Bartok_14380_14467","E♭, furthermore, is not convincingly established as a dominant-functioning tone at all."
"Bartok_14468_14695","The passage from measures 85-89 is centered on E♭ (and the pentatonic set from the opening of the exposition is transposed down a whole step), but its mere presence as local tonic does not signify any sort of dominant function."
"Bartok_14696_14879","Rather, we can consider this occurrence of E♭ as a middleground-level whole-tone descent that foreshadows the structural descent to E♭ at measure 131 that is represented in Example 2."
"Bartok_14880_14995","In measures 91-95, the bass descends F-E♭-D♭-C, which might seem to support C’s functioning as structural dominant."
"Bartok_14996_15149","However, as previously mentioned, C acts as a “fake” dominant that in measures 149-155 actually functions as an upper neighbor to B, the “true” dominant."
"Bartok_15150_15324","The descent in measures 91-95 in fact participates in the farce by projecting a descent ending on C, which makes the eventual reinterpretation of C and descent to B stronger."
"Bartok_15325_15493","This creates both a smooth transition to the second theme and a strong sense that a new section is beginning, a combination that is generally rather difficult to forge."
"Bartok_15506_15606","The second theme is tranquil and harmonically simple, which is in stark contrast to the first theme."
"Bartok_15607_15704","B dominates as tonal center from measures 155-191 with little or no harmonic motion away from it."
"Bartok_15705_15797","Measures 192-197 are in E♭, with the bass notes in the harp, and measures 198-209 are in D♭."
"Bartok_15798_15910","A♭ intervenes between E♭ and D♭ in measure 195—another instance of the whole-tone being “filled in” by a fourth."
"Bartok_15911_15998","The return to B in measure 210 is also filled-in in this way by F♯ in measures 208-209."
"Bartok_15999_16176","Hence, measures 155-210 constitute the bass progression B-E♭-D♭-B; the same stepwise descent (E♭-D♭) occurred in the first theme group while F rather than B was being prolonged."
"Bartok_16177_16347","Paul Wilson points out that “[i]n substituting for F within an analogous structure, B receives confirmation at this point as the crucial interior center of the movement.”"
"Bartok_16205_16347","“[i]n substituting for F within an analogous structure, B receives confirmation at this point as the crucial interior center of the movement.”"
"Bartok_16395_16500","In our terminology, this is the point at which B is unequivocally established as the structural dominant."
"Bartok_16513_16528","The Development"
"Bartok_16541_16605","As mentioned, the development is divided into three subsections."
"Bartok_16606_16856","In Example 2, the entire development section is represented by exactly three pitches, and indeed each subsection is associated with one of these three pitches as its tonal center—none of these pitches is involved in the structural whole-tone descent."
"Bartok_16857_17075","As Paul Wilson states, the development “is, for Bartók’s music, developmental in a relatively conventional way”; the themes from the exposition are expanded and modified, and tonalities other than those expected arise."
"Bartok_16896_16968","“is, for Bartók’s music, developmental in a relatively conventional way”"
"Bartok_17123_17306","The only slight abnormality, though it is certainly not unheard of even in classical-period sonata movements, is the emergence of a new theme in the second section of the development."
"Bartok_17307_17446","Although Wilson claims that this theme is based on “a transformation in rhythm and contour of the second head-motive of [the first-theme],”"
"Bartok_17358_17446","“a transformation in rhythm and contour of the second head-motive of [the first-theme],”"
"Bartok_17465_17477","Wilson, 182."
"Bartok_17494_17663","there is no intervallic relationship between the two motives, and it is not clear what elements of a motive remain when rhythm, contour and interval content are changed."
"Bartok_17664_17793","Furthermore, this section, being the middle section of the movement, upholds the formal symmetry if interpreted as its own theme."
"Bartok_17806_17962","The first section of the development, measures 231-271, begins with a big D-minor chord which immediately establishes D as the tonal center for the section."
"Bartok_17963_18104","Although it moves to E♭ minor in measure 239, it returns to D minor in measure 248, which suggests that E♭ is an upper neighbor prolonging D."
"Bartok_18105_18283","The passage beginning at measure 248, shown in Example 13, can be considered to be the “theme” of this section, and is a development of the second head motive of the first theme."
"Bartok_18284_18353","This motive undergoes inversion and extension throughout the section."
"Bartok_18354_18624","While Wilson rightly identifies the resultant set of measures 261-264 as 6-Z50 ([014679]), identifying it as such does not offer much analytical insight until we point out that this is a simple extension of the intervallic sequence (+5, -2, +5) from the original motive."
"Bartok_18730_18809","The second section of the development is in C♯ (which is sometimes spelled D♭)."
"Bartok_18810_18851","This section is reproduced as Example 14."
"Bartok_18852_18996","This section returns to the calm simplicity (and tempo) of the second section, though apart from affect there are no references to that section."
"Bartok_18997_19170","Although the C♯ major chord in measure 293, preceded by A♭ major (V) in measure 285, suggests C♯ as tonal center, the tonality is not strongly established until measure 303."
"Bartok_19171_19354","The arrival at C♯ was foreshadowed by the first two measures of the development (Example 15), which are almost a direct transposition of the two head motives of the first theme to C♯."
"Bartok_19373_19548","Because of its emphasis here in the development section and its position as leading to B in the second theme group, we could conceive of C# as a sub-dominant in this movement."
"Bartok_19549_19827","As tempting as this interpretation may be, this observation is relegated to the notes section because it constitutes a horrible abuse of terminology—there is only so far that such tonal analogies can go before they begin to hide any true analytical insight behind misused terms."
"Bartok_20117_20365","The third section of the development takes the trombone motive from the transition between the first and second sections of the exposition shown in Example 12, transposed to begin on F, and turns it into a fugato sequence, reproduced in Example 17."
"Bartok_20366_20482","The tonal center B♭ is established immediately in measures 316-318 by the strong V-I chord progression (Example 16)."
"Bartok_20483_20678","As previously mentioned, the fugato motive incorporates the motion by perfect fourths found in the Introduction as well as the intervallic cell found in the second head motive of the first theme."
"Bartok_20679_20797","The resultant set is the pentatonic set F-B♭-E♭-A♭-D♭; the entire passage shown in Example 17 remains within this set."
"Bartok_20798_21023","The second and fourth entrances of the fugato subject are transposed up a perfect fifth, but the first note is B♭ rather than C, which allows Bartók to remain in this pentatonic set (and also to reinforce B♭ as tonal center)."
"Bartok_21140_21307","The second instance of the fugato section, not reproduced in its entirety but based on the subject in Example 18, is an exact pitch inversion transposed to begin on C."
"Bartok_21308_21386","The inversion blends seamlessly back into the original subject in measure 363."
"Bartok_21387_21700","The following section (measures 363-389) especially brings out the quartal harmonies within the pentatonic set, so much so that B♭ is obscured as tonal center which allows A♭ to emerge as the goal tone of this section—only to be immediately reinterpreted as a leading tone to the A that begins the recapitulation."
"Bartok_21701_21944","Both B♭ and A♭ are chromatic neighbors to A, which intensifies the arrival on A, and brings out the fact that the appearance of A continues the large-scale whole-tone descent that has been left stranded on B for the entire development section."
"Bartok_22180_22198","The Recapitulation"
"Bartok_22211_22285","The recapitulation, as we have seen, presents the themes in reverse order."
"Bartok_22286_22434","The second theme is initially presented in A, as part of the whole-tone descent, and proceeds directly to G, where it is restated slightly modified."
"Bartok_22435_22598","It is worth pointing out that the arrival on G at measure 425 is led into by D, which constitutes another “filling in” of the whole-step by the intervening fourth."
"Bartok_22599_22747","The A♯ in measure 438 might initially seem to be a new tonal area, but it leads to D in measure 444, which constitutes a V chord still applied to G."
"Bartok_22748_22868","Rather than resolve this D back to G, however, Bartók shifts briefly to F♯ in measure 456 and leads to E in measure 467."
"Bartok_22869_23164","E and F♯ are both active throughout the entire transition from second theme back to first theme (measures 456-487) which brings out their functions as upper and lower chromatic neighbors to F, which returns triumphantly in measure 488 with the much-anticipated recapitulation of the first theme."
"Bartok_23177_23298","The return of the first theme is certainly immediately recognized as such; however, there are some important differences."
"Bartok_23299_23487","Firstly, its initial appearance in the exposition had a minor flare to it; the first chord in Example 9 is an F-minor triad, and the first four notes of Example 8 ascend the F-minor scale."
"Bartok_23488_23626","In the recapitulation of this theme, shown in Example 19, the first chord is an F-major chord, and the A♭ is replaced by A♮ in the melody."
"Bartok_23627_24007","In fact, the chord progression of the first four measures of Example 19 can be thought of tonally as I-vi-V in F major—while we are reluctant to say that this passage is in major (the conspicuous A♭ in measure 490 easily brings doubt to this interpretation), we can certainly say that the minor flare of the beginning has been replaced by a major flare here in the recapitulation."
"Bartok_24020_24261","In addition to the “mode”-shift, we notice that the metric dissonance shown in Examples 9 and 10 no longer appears (notice how regular the rhythm of the accompanying figure is in Example 19) and also that the written meter no longer changes."
"Bartok_24262_24478","In other words, the piece, in becoming more regular, is beginning to drive towards the finish—because of the formal structure, the recapitulation of the first theme also serves as the closing section of the movement."
"Bartok_24479_24635","Indeed, this section has the feel of a Coda to it—it is much shorter than any other major section or subsection, and the tonic harmony is active throughout."
"Bartok_24636_24881","There are also no phrase divisions—the music simply drives forward with no pause until measure 514, where the fugato motive appears in the brass over an obvious V-I cadence, signaling the end of the movement which occurs as the motive completes."
"Bartok_25058_25137","There is no fine line between music that is “tonal” and music that is “atonal.”"
"Bartok_25138_25272","Bartók is one of the many early-twentieth century composers whose music fits entirely in the gray area between tonality and atonality."
"Bartok_25273_25588","While we know from his writings that he often composed with a tonal centers and relationships in mind, and that he regularly applied tonal structures and forms to his compositions, by merely glancing at any one of his pieces we can see that tonality as it is understood in the common practice period is not at work."
"Bartok_25589_25843","Thanks largely to the work of tonal theorists such as Heinrich Schenker and others, we have a detailed system for analyzing tonal music—their system, however, is virtually useless in analyzing music that falls entirely on the atonal side of the spectrum."
"Bartok_25844_25986","But if we apply it to music such as Bartók’s that is in the middle area, we can come up with some enlightening and perhaps unexpected results."
"Bartok_25987_26078","To do so was the goal of this analysis of the first movement of the Concerto for Orchestra."
"Bartok_26079_26300","By applying our tonal system to music that slips outside of the tonal realm, we not only find the elements of tonality that do remain, but we also pinpoint exactly when and how this music breaks from previous conventions."
"Bartok_26301_26401","It is not disputed that Bartók’s music has great expressive power—perhaps now we can understand why."

"Black_and_white_13291_13469","Furthermore, with the advent of industrialization the invention of new synthetic dyes meant that color in dress became democratized for all classes."

"Homosexuality_2984_3099","Hirschfeld also founded the Scientific Humanitarian committee, which was mostly homosexual, in 1897."
"Homosexuality_3100_3258","The committee published many books and other forms of literature, which gave Hirschfeld a great amount of prestige in his field."
"Homosexuality_3259_3549","He became known as one of the founding fathers of sexology, and furthered this position when he opened the world’s first sexological institute, the institute for Sexual Science in Berlin, in 1919, which was destroyed by the Nazis 15 years later."
"Homosexuality_3550_3848","Hirschfeld largely supported the Urning theory of Karl Ulrichs, with minor additions; he believed in some hormonal theories as a cause of homosexuality, but this only led to unsuccessful attempts to “cure” homosexuals with the use of hormone injections."
"Homosexuality_3849_4031","This theory, which defined Urnings as males who turned to other males as sexual partners, was published in twelve pamphlets by Ulrichs, starting in1864."
"Homosexuality_4032_4215","The first, Vindex, defended Urnings, while the second, Inclusa, which followed shortly after, described the first scientific theory of homoerotic desire."
"Homosexuality_4216_4527","Ulrichs believed that Urnings were attracted to other males because they were “hermaphrodites of the mind,” meaning while they may have been male in body, they were female in soul and mind, leading them to be naturally attracted to males in terms of sexual partners."
"Homosexuality_4309_4338","“hermaphrodites of the mind,”"
"Homosexuality_4528_4853","This, he claimed, made laws such as paragraph 175, a law adopted by King William I throughout the German Kingdoms at the time of their unification which forbade sex between males, and forced criminal penalties upon individuals partaking in such behavior, unfair and unreasonable ."
"Homosexuality_4854_4956","Ulrichs claimed that the origin of such a disposition was natural and inborn (Wikholm)."
"Homosexuality_4969_5099","A couple thousand years after Plato and Homer, Sigmund Freud still believed homosexuality to be a natural behavior."
"Homosexuality_5100_5296","In an interview in 1903, he professed his beliefs: “I am… of the firm conviction that homosexuals must not be treated as sick people… Homosexual persons are not sick."
"Homosexuality_5166_5340","“I am… of the firm conviction that homosexuals must not be treated as sick people… Homosexual persons are not sick. They also do not belong in a court of law!”"
"Homosexuality_5297_5340","They also do not belong in a court of law!”"
"Homosexuality_5356_5373","(qtd. in Isay 3)."
"Homosexuality_5374_5803","In 1935, he furthered his claims when he wrote a now famous “Letter to an American Mother” of a homosexual, which stated that “Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it cannot be classified as an illness… Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been homosexuals” (qtd. in Isay 3)."

"Homosexuality_5515_5785","“Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it cannot be classified as an illness… Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been homosexuals”"
"Homosexuality_5816_5977","However, the general public of the 1800s and early 1900s, including the medical professionals, regarded homosexuality as a curable mental illness."
"Homosexuality_5978_6117","Treatments such as castration, hysterectomy, lobotomy, and electroshock therapy were used as attempted cures."
"Homosexuality_6118_6327","By the mid 1900s, psychotherapy became the most common “cure,” and many homosexuals spent countless hours being analyzed in hopes of changing their sexual preference (Dudley 125)."
"Homosexuality_6173_6180","“cure,”"
"Homosexuality_6340_6497","Dr. Evelyn Hooker, a heterosexual psychologist, conducted a ground-breaking study in the mid 1950s that went along similar reasoning as Freud."
"Homosexuality_6498_6654","In this courageous experiment, Hooker compared the psychological profiles of sixty men, half homosexual and half heterosexual."
"Homosexuality_6655_6979","She disagreed with the popular belief at the time that homosexuality was a mental illness, and concluded that there was no significant psychological difference between homosexual and heterosexual men; “gay” men were no more insane than their “straight” counterparts (Marcus 183)."
"Homosexuality_6886_6891","“gay”"
"Homosexuality_6942_6952","“straight”"
"Homosexuality_6992_7465","Fortunately, many prominent psychiatrists also believed that homosexuality was not an illness, and their lobbying, along with the innovative study performed by Hooker, who has been referred to as “the Rosa Parks of the gay movement” convinced the American Psychiatric Association Board of Trustees to vote to remove homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual as a mental illness in December of 1973."
"Homosexuality_7218_7254","“the Rosa Parks of the gay movement”"
"Homosexuality_7466_7634","Just over a year later, the American Psychological Association also removed homosexuality from their list of mental illnesses (Marcus 11)."
"Homosexuality_7635_8028","The American Psychological Association further reiterated this belief when an overwhelming majority of the Council of Representatives adopted the Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation in 1997, which publicly chastised those who attempted to “cure” homosexuality by means of various forms of treatment."
"Homosexuality_7953_7959","“cure”"
"Homosexuality_8029_8337","It stated, rather that homosexuality was merely a difference in the opinion and values of the common person, but must still be respected as an individual orientation, and thus treated as one (Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation)."
"Homosexuality_8350_8723","Perhaps one of the most famous studies on this topic was concluded in 1991 by Michael Bailey, an assistant professor of psychology at Northwestern University, and Richard Pillard, an associate professor of psychiatry at Boston University School of Medicine, and found that sexual orientation in males is largely due to genetics."
"Homosexuality_8724_9309","For two years, these men studied the number of occurrences of homosexuality in both monozygotic, or identical twins (a set of twins coming from the same fertilized egg and thus having identical DNA), and dizygotic, or fraternal twins (a set of twins from too separate zygotes, causing them to have similar DNA, but not any more so than that of two ordinary siblings), in addition to adoptive brothers of gay males (meaning that all of these males would have been raised in the same environment)."
"Homosexuality_9310_9582","In total, 110 pairs of twins (identical and fraternal) and 142 sets of male and their adopted brothers were studied, where at least one of the two had been classified as homosexual, either by self-identification or other means."
"Homosexuality_9583_10020","Out of the 56 homosexual males who had identical twins, 29, or approximately 52 % of their identical twin brothers were also found to be homosexual, as compared to only 12, or approximately 22 % of the 54 non-identical twins of homosexual males, and 6, or approximately 11 % of the 57 adopted brothers of homosexual males who were unrelated in terms of genetics."
"Homosexuality_10021_10369","Strangely enough, the study also included pairs of biological brothers that were not twins, and out of the 142 homosexual males studied, only 14, or about 9 %, had homosexual brothers, which is approximately the normal statistical incidence of homosexuality in the general population (Bailey & Pillard)."
"Homosexuality_10382_10524","More and more people are beginning to believe that homosexuality is not a “choice,” but rather a feeling that one is born with."
"Homosexuality_10456_10465","“choice,”"
"Homosexuality_10525_10619","As one grows older, they become aware of sexual feelings towards other persons."
"Homosexuality_10620_10833","The only difference between homosexuals and heterosexuals is that while heterosexuals are attracted to members of the opposite sex, homosexuals are attracted to those of the same sex."
"Homosexuality_10834_11134","Therefore, neither homosexuals nor heterosexuals really have a “choice” in the matter, and asking a homosexual “Why are you attracted to other members of your sex” is likened to asking a heterosexual “Why are you attracted to members of the opposite sex?”"
"Homosexuality_10975_11027","“Why are you attracted to other members of your sex”"
"Homosexuality_11079_11134","“Why are you attracted to members of the opposite sex?”"
"Homosexuality_11135_11212","After all, why would anyone choose such a difficult lifestyle?"
"Homosexuality_11213_11522","As a homosexual, one risks horrifying their parents, other family members, and friends to the point of losing all contact with them, ruining their career, being condemned by their religion, being beat up for publicly displaying their sexuality, and much much more."
"Homosexuality_11523_11854","Rather, the only actual choice is whether or not to be open with one’s sexuality and sexual preference; whether to act on one’s sexual desires, whether to tell others about such feelings, or whether to live a whole life as a lie and suppress these attractions (Marcus 9)."
"Homosexuality_11867_12029","To supplement my findings from research, I have conducted personal interviews with two adolescent homosexual males, James Dobbens and Daniel Woods."
"Homosexuality_12030_12234","Both were asked how what they thought determined homosexuality (nature vs. nurture) and why, when they realized they were homosexual and how they knew, and similar questions."
"Homosexuality_12235_12342","Both believed that homosexual was a result of nature, rather than nurture (Dobbens & Woods)."
"Homosexuality_12358_12505","Dobbens reasoned that most parents would not raise their children to be homosexual; “They’re not like ‘My child’s going to be gay!”’"
"Homosexuality_12457_12505","“They’re not like ‘My child’s going to be gay!”’"
"Homosexuality_12475_12505","‘My child’s going to be gay!”’"
"Homosexuality_12506_12516","(Dobbens)."
"Homosexuality_12517_12577","Dobbens believes that he was born homosexual."
"Homosexuality_12578_12800","When why he was a homosexual, he explained “It’s just the way you are, you can’t explain it, I was just born that way, it’s like asking how the world was made – no one really knows” (Dobbens)."
"Homosexuality_12621_12789","“It’s just the way you are, you can’t explain it, I was just born that way, it’s like asking how the world was made – no one really knows”"
"Homosexuality_12801_12929","He went on to explain that while his nurture did not impact his sexual orientation, it did affect his view of it."
"Homosexuality_12930_13477","When discussing the role of parents and upbringing in a child’s sexuality, he commented “They can bring you up [to be] open minded to [homosexuality], but they don’t bring you up [to be a homosexual]… I grew up in a place where [homosexuality is accepted], so that’s why I’m so open about being gay; I accept myself… [Whether or not you accept homosexuality and can be honest with yourself if you are homosexual] depends on how you’re brought up” (Dobbens)."
"Homosexuality_13048_13466","“They can bring you up [to be] open minded to [homosexuality], but they don’t bring you up [to be a homosexual]… I grew up in a place where [homosexuality is accepted], so that’s why I’m so open about being gay; I accept myself… [Whether or not you accept homosexuality and can be honest with yourself if you are homosexual] depends on how you’re brought up”"
"Homosexuality_13478_13768","Woods generally agreed with Dobbens, and justified his belief that homosexuality was caused by one’s nature, rather than nurture, when he commented that “there’s nothing in my upbringing that exposed me to anything like [homosexuality]” (Woods)."
"Homosexuality_13769_13939","When asked why he was gay, he explained that it is simply “something that I can’t help… embedded in my head; nothing made me do it” (Woods)."
"Homosexuality_13842_13930","“something that I can’t help… embedded in my head; nothing made me do it”"
"Homosexuality_13940_14097","He went on to explain that it the same thing as the primitive attraction between males and females, only it was between males and other males."
"Homosexuality_14098_14193","He added that “nothing happened [to make me homosexual]; it’s always been there."
"Homosexuality_14127_14244","“nothing happened [to make me homosexual]; it’s always been there. I’ve always been attracted to guys”"
"Homosexuality_14194_14253","I’ve always been attracted to guys” (Woods)."
"Homosexuality_14254_14585","What I find to be extraordinary about Woods’ case is that he remarked how while he has always been sexually attracted go guys, he is romantically attracted to women in the sense that he has always wanted a girlfriend and to be close with other females, etc… but never in a sexual sense."
"Homosexuality_14586_14789","Though he has “always kind of fantasized about getting married [to a female],” these feelings come from his “romantic side, which is different from the sexual side” (Woods)."
"Homosexuality_14615_14679","“always kind of fantasized about getting married [to a female],”"
"Homosexuality_14724_14780","“romantic side, which is different from the sexual side”"
"Homosexuality_14790_14920","He says that if he married a female with which he shared a strong trust, maybe he could work it out."
"Homosexuality_14921_15027","He then went back to talk about homosexuality as in innate characteristic; “It’s like race."
"Homosexuality_15011_15132","“It’s like race. It’s all something you can’t help; it all comes to you… It’s internal, you can’t help it”"
"Homosexuality_15028_15141","It’s all something you can’t help; it all comes to you… It’s internal, you can’t help it” (Woods)."
"Homosexuality_15142_15279","When asked if he thought homosexuality was caused by a gene, he commented that he thought that it was more of an instinct."
"Homosexuality_15280_15427","He gave the example of birds, which are born with instincts such as knowing how to build a next, or catch their prey."
"Homosexuality_15428_15533","Woods also thought that maybe it was caused by something in the development of the embryo."
"Homosexuality_15534_15604","All in all, Woods views homosexuality as “fascinating.”"
"Homosexuality_15590_15604","“fascinating.”"
"Homosexuality_15605_15703","His final thought: “I also believe everyone has at least one homosexual attraction."
"Homosexuality_15624_15791","“I also believe everyone has at least one homosexual attraction. It’s not black and white [homosexual vs. heterosexual]; it’s a spectrum”"
"Homosexuality_15704_15800","It’s not black and white [homosexual vs. heterosexual]; it’s a spectrum” (Woods)."
"Homosexuality_15813_15881","Yet there are arguments against homosexuality as caused by genetics."
"Homosexuality_15882_16052","According to Darwin’s theory of natural selection, the advantageous traits are passed on, while the disadvantageous ones eventually die out."
"Homosexuality_16053_16315","For instance, heterosexual males have an average of five times as many children as homosexual ones, as a female is required to reproduce children, yet homosexuals are, by definition, not sexually attracted to females."
"Homosexuality_16316_16432","Therefore, from the evolutionary standpoint, homosexuality becomes one of the disadvantageous traits."
"Homosexuality_16433_16743","Because consequently heterosexual men contribute five times as much genetic information to the next the gene pool, if homosexuality was indeed caused by a gene, it would have died out entirely by now, or at least been reduced immensely in the number of occurrences."
"Homosexuality_16744_16901","Since neither of these events have yet taken place, it can be concluded that homosexuality is not caused by a gene (Fulkerson)."
"Homosexuality_16914_17052","My findings throughout my research have led me to conclude that there is no definitive answer on what causes homosexuality."
"Homosexuality_17053_17175","No one knows for sure now (although many think they do), and perhaps no one ever will know the whole truth."
"Homosexuality_17176_17337","Nonetheless, I am apt to believe that homosexuality is the product of some kind of combination of genetic and environmental causes."
"Homosexuality_17338_17471","Perhaps one may have a genetic predisposition towards homosexuality that has been passed on from previous generations."
"Homosexuality_17472_17630","However this does not necessarily determine a homosexual; rather this predisposition must be triggered by environmental factors."
"Homosexuality_17631_17898","This is why Bailey and Pillard found in their study that while they was a greatly elevated chance that two males sharing the same genetic makeup would also share the same sexuality, this was not the case 100 % of the time."
"Homosexuality_17899_18023","This seems to be the most likely explanation as of now, but even as I write this, new studies are being done."
"Homosexuality_18024_18069","Perhaps the truth is right around the corner."

"Ohio_Steel_213_241","An Extended Essay in History"
"Ohio_Steel_546_628","September 19, 1977 is a date that few people in Youngstown, Ohio will ever forget."
"Ohio_Steel_629_802","On that date Jennings Lambeth, president of Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company, announced that most of the steel company’s Campbell Works would close."
"Ohio_Steel_803_961","Although for other cities this would simply be a minor economic setback, for the people of Youngstown and the surrounding area, it meant disaster."
"Ohio_Steel_962_1201","Mahoning County was a one-industry area, and the people of Youngstown, Struthers, Campbell, Boardman Township, and the numerous other small towns and villages in the area only had one main employer: the steel mills."
"Ohio_Steel_1215_1445","The events that would follow this date (known as Black Monday) are seen by the people who witnessed them either as stories of great courage and determination or as monuments to human failure and false hope."
"Ohio_Steel_1446_1644","Rather than sit back and wait for their jobs to be snatched away, the workers and local union members in the mills fought long and hard to be able to keep the factories open."
"Ohio_Steel_1645_1902","Petitions, protests, rallies, collectivization, and even the takeover of a steel company’s headquarters were all attempted in a desperate movement by those in the industry to preserve the only source of employment that this town had."
"Ohio_Steel_1903_2054","These well-intentioned efforts ultimately failed, leaving thousands with shattered dreams and a distinct lack of trust in fellow humankind."
"Ohio_Steel_2068_2196","But why did the brave attempts by union leaders and concerned citizens to revive the steel industry ultimately fail?"
"Ohio_Steel_2197_2827","When examining the area’s history, culture, and economic situation we can identify four main reasons: the refusal of the international leadership of United Steelworkers of America to support their union’s Youngstown branch, the lagging international steel market, the lack of a clear, organized vision for individual initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign, and crippling regionalism which caused animosity between different small towns in the region, all contributed in some way to the failure of the workers and union leaders to save the industry."
"Ohio_Steel_2828_2897","Most importantly, the problem in Youngstown was a nationwide problem."
"Ohio_Steel_2898_3091","Although it affected Youngstown and the surrounding area more than it affected other regions, the local people simply could not solve a national crisis on a local level."
"Ohio_Steel_3118_3163","A Brief History of Steel in Northeastern Ohio"
"Ohio_Steel_3165_3299","In 1802 James and Daniel Heaton discovered ore and coal lining Yellow Creek in an area outside of Youngstown known as Poland Township."
"Ohio_Steel_3300_3378","Their blast furnace, “Hopewell,” was the very first blast furnace in the area."
"Ohio_Steel_3379_3479","During the Civil War, Youngstown played a vital role in supplying the Union army with iron products."
"Ohio_Steel_3480_3611","Youngstown also was a major railway crossroads, due to its strategic position between Cleveland, Pittsburgh, New York, and Chicago."
"Ohio_Steel_3612_3754","In fact, “More rail cars passed under the Center Street Bridge [a major bridge in Youngstown] per day than any other location in the country.”"
"Ohio_Steel_3756_4036","During the 19th century, the center of iron manufacturing had gradually shifted from the far East Coast (Massachusetts and Eastern Pennsylvania) to the Ohio Valley Pittsburgh regions of the Northeast, including the Mahoning Valley and the Hanging Rock region of Ohio and Kentucky."
"Ohio_Steel_4037_4159","By 1880, Youngstown’s population had grown to nearly 16,000, which meant it had doubled in size over a twenty-year period."
"Ohio_Steel_4160_4277","The town continued to prosper, driven by the flux of immigrants pouring in with the hopes of employment at the mills."
"Ohio_Steel_4278_4370","This prosperity continued until the late 1920s, when the Great Depression hit the area hard."
"Ohio_Steel_4371_4536","Despite the Congress of Industrial Organization’s successful efforts to establish a national steel workers’ union, the industry barely survived the Depression years."
"Ohio_Steel_4537_4723","Finally, the outbreak of the Second World War made iron and steel important again, and Youngstown was bolstered out of its economic standstill into a fast-paced period of booming growth."
"Ohio_Steel_4725_4863","Youngstown may have been an important and prosperous region in the post-war period, but the seeds for its downfall were slowly being sown."
"Ohio_Steel_4864_4966","Strikes racked the town during the forties, fifties, and sixties, and they were often long and bloody."
"Ohio_Steel_4967_5026","In 1973, the Experimental Negotiating Agreement was signed."
"Ohio_Steel_5027_5130","This prohibited strikes and lockout, angering workers and driving productivity and laborer morale down."
"Ohio_Steel_5131_5421","At the same time, stricter governmental standards for environmental protection and the growth of imported steel were making it harder to produce and market American steel parts, and the overeager shareholders in the companies’ stock were pushing for more and more of their share of the pie."
"Ohio_Steel_5422_5520","Most importantly, Youngstown’s steel mills were slowly becoming less efficient and more expensive."
"Ohio_Steel_5521_5669","Old technology was not replaced, obsolete methods were not updated, and almost none of the industry’s profits were being utilized to help modernize."
"Ohio_Steel_5670_5791","It was a recipe for disaster that would soon explode in the faces of hundreds of thousands of workers and their families."
"Ohio_Steel_5793_5841","Black Monday and the Crash of the Steel Industry"
"Ohio_Steel_5842_5990","The announcement of the closing of the mills in 1977 was the beginning of a downward spiral, which would send the entire valley into chaos and ruin."
"Ohio_Steel_5991_6099","Between 1977 and 1981, a total of five mills were closed and approximately 25,000 jobs were lost countywide."
"Ohio_Steel_6100_6241","Meetings of union officials and mill bosses were hurriedly set up in an attempt to persuade the powers that be to reconsider their statement."
"Ohio_Steel_6242_6372","However, it was clear that, in the words of USWA president Lloyd McBride, “If you can’t make a buck, you get out of the business.”"
"Ohio_Steel_6316_6372","“If you can’t make a buck, you get out of the business.”"
"Ohio_Steel_6375_6506","The closings meant the end of Youngstown’s only real industry, the end of its population growth, and then end of economic progress."
"Ohio_Steel_6507_6622","Without the mills, people sought other places of employment in adjoining states or even other areas of the country."
"Ohio_Steel_6623_6729","Those that could afford to move did so; those that couldn’t afford to move mostly ended up on the streets."
"Ohio_Steel_6730_6804","Without an industrial or a residential base, commerce shrank considerably."
"Ohio_Steel_6805_7000","It was becoming increasingly clear that without the industrial base provided by the mills, the city of Youngstown would soon become a ghost town, inhabited by those too poor or hopeful to escape."
"Ohio_Steel_7001_7112","The workers decided they needed to do something to save their city, and so they mobilized in a variety of ways."
"Ohio_Steel_7114_7140","Attempts to Save the Mills"
"Ohio_Steel_7142_7287","The very first thing that the workers could do was “to get up a petition to stop the shutdown,” says Ed Mann, a local union leader and organizer."
"Ohio_Steel_7193_7237","“to get up a petition to stop the shutdown,”"
"Ohio_Steel_7289_7451","The petition was circulated, eventually including thousands of signatures; it was then given to USWA representatives to present to President Carter in Washington."
"Ohio_Steel_7452_7599","However, the representatives were shunted to the side and ignored in Washington, since Youngstown’s political influence had died with its industry."
"Ohio_Steel_7601_7721","The International chapter of the USWA had much more lobbying power, but they refused to support the local union members."
"Ohio_Steel_7722_7787","The petition was lost among paperwork and bureaucratic procedure."
"Ohio_Steel_7789_7948","Next, workers decided to form the Ecumenical Coalition, an organization of local religious groups which spearheaded the attempt to reopen the Youngstown works."
"Ohio_Steel_7949_8077","The Coalition drafter letters to the Lykes Company asking if a group of workers might purchase the mill and run it collectively."
"Ohio_Steel_8078_8166","Lykes ignored the letters, so the Coalition turned once again to the federal government."
"Ohio_Steel_8167_8196","Here, too, they were ignored."
"Ohio_Steel_8197_8317","The Coalition had no proper funds to buy the mills, so they could do nothing but sit back and watch as the mills closed."
"Ohio_Steel_8319_8460","Finally, following the shutdown of US Steel’s plant in 1980, local union leaders congregated outside the US Steel Headquarters in Youngstown."
"Ohio_Steel_8461_8572","They invited local people and politicians to witness the scene, then charged the Headquarters and took it over."
"Ohio_Steel_8573_8693","The workers stayed there until the next day, when US Steel declared that they were ready to talk about selling the mill."
"Ohio_Steel_8694_8906","Immediately after the workers left the building, US steel representatives told the local union leaders that they had changed their minds and were no longer interested in allowing the workers to purchase the mill."
"Ohio_Steel_8908_8999","All these efforts eventually came to nothing, and Youngstown’s steel mills remained closed."
"Ohio_Steel_9000_9177","These attempts to save the mills were hindered by several major factors, including the decline of the world steel market, which made American steel impossible to sell or export."
"Ohio_Steel_9179_9210","The Decline of the World Market"
"Ohio_Steel_9211_9319","The efforts to save the mills failed partly because the international market for steel had largely dried up."
"Ohio_Steel_9320_9505","During World War II the rest of the world was hungry for America’s iron and steel products; however, by the seventies no foreign nations needed to import steel in such large quantities."
"Ohio_Steel_9506_9573","In fact, American steel imports were beginning to outweigh exports."
"Ohio_Steel_9575_9680","Foreign steel was easier and more efficient to make, and was often of higher quality than domestic steel."
"Ohio_Steel_9681_9796","Foreign steel companies invested in their factories, updating their technology and replacing their equipment often."
"Ohio_Steel_9797_9952","This meant that foreign facilities were more modern and efficient than any plants in America, and therefore were able to export a more competitive product."
"Ohio_Steel_9954_9990","Foreign steel was also much cheaper."
"Ohio_Steel_9991_10120","Wage hikes, although they helped to improve living conditions of steel workers in the US, made American steel far more expensive."
"Ohio_Steel_10121_10196","Also, international competitors drew on a large supply of very cheap labor."
"Ohio_Steel_10197_10337","Jobs were scarce in other steel-exporting countries, and labor laws were either non-existent or allowed employers to pay much less for work."
"Ohio_Steel_10338_10547","Labor costs in America continued to go up, draining US companies of their resources, while companies overseas were able to cut labor costs and put that money back into updating and renovating their facilities."
"Ohio_Steel_10549_10688","On a worldwide scale, newer materials such as aluminum, plastic, and composites were beginning to substitute steel both at home and abroad."
"Ohio_Steel_10689_10790","Steel demand worldwide was beginning to decline, and it affected both domestic and foreign companies."
"Ohio_Steel_10791_10967","However, to American companies already suffering financial setbacks, outdated machinery, and fierce competition, this lack of demand was an inconvenience they could not afford."
"Ohio_Steel_10968_11076","America’s steel remained unsold, flooding the world market with inferior products that no one wanted to buy."
"Ohio_Steel_11078_11204","Since this problem was a national one rather than a local one, the problems that were occurring in Youngstown were not unique."
"Ohio_Steel_11205_11319","Youngstown was perhaps hit harder than any other town by the collapse of the steel industry, but it was not alone."
"Ohio_Steel_11320_11413","The problem was a national one, involving many more mills and issues than Youngstown’s alone."
"Ohio_Steel_11414_11584","J. Philip Richley, a union member and organizer of many attempts to save 5the mills, has summed it up thus: “You just can’t solve a nation-wide problem in a single city.”"
"Ohio_Steel_11522_11584","“You just can’t solve a nation-wide problem in a single city.”"
"Ohio_Steel_11585_11694","The decline of the world steel market affected not just Youngstown but the entire steel community in America."
"Ohio_Steel_11695_11819","Trying to prop up one city’s mills was impossible when faced with the depression that spread throughout the entire industry."
"Ohio_Steel_11821_11874","The Save Our Valley Campaign: Lack of Funds and Plans"
"Ohio_Steel_11875_12057","Eventually, some religious leaders involved in the Ecumenical Coalition joined forces within community members and former steel mill employees to create the Save Our Valley Campaign."
"Ohio_Steel_12058_12270","As the name suggests, local leaders wanted to instill the people of Youngstown with a fierce sense of urgency, driving them forward to confront steel companies and owners and help secure the future of the region."
"Ohio_Steel_12271_12379","Marches, speeches, and letter writing were all employed to help stimulate the Campaign and rally the people."
"Ohio_Steel_12380_12451","But the Campaign was bogged down heavily by the lack of proper funding."
"Ohio_Steel_12452_12560","The people of Youngstown, being now unemployed had very little money to spend on anything but staying alive."
"Ohio_Steel_12561_12666","College tuition, clothes, food, and heating all had to come before donations to non-profit organizations."
"Ohio_Steel_12667_12821","People outside of the area had no personal investment in the mills, and so it was difficult to convince anyone from out of the county to contribute funds."
"Ohio_Steel_12822_12958","The lack of money proved to be crippling, because it prevented the organizations involved from purchasing the mills to run collectively."
"Ohio_Steel_12959_13067","Without funds, the Save Our Valley Campaign could do nothing major to help salvage the city’s dying economy."
"Ohio_Steel_13069_13159","The Save Our Valley Campaign also lacked one essential component: an actual concrete plan."
"Ohio_Steel_13160_13223","No one seemed to know just how to go about fixing the problems."
"Ohio_Steel_13224_13311","Letters and petitions were all very well, but they did little to improve the situation."
"Ohio_Steel_13312_13542","People clung to vague ideas of worker collectivization, but no one could really fathom exactly how that would work; the people of Youngstown were, after all, not particularly familiar with socialism or collectivization in general."
"Ohio_Steel_13543_13777","Beyond that, no one knew how they should proceed: everyone knew that saving the mills was important, but nobody stepped forward with a full-fledged plan to do it without losing huge amounts of money and dragging even more people down."
"Ohio_Steel_13778_13831","Without a real plan, nothing could truly be achieved."
"Ohio_Steel_13833_13953","Without funds to drive the efforts, or even a real plan of action, the Save Our Valley Campaign did more harm than good."
"Ohio_Steel_13954_14046","In effect, it raised the hopes of workers without having any real chance at saving anything."
"Ohio_Steel_14047_14126","People became excited and waited for the mills to reappear, but they never did."
"Ohio_Steel_14127_14211","The Campaign failed to save any jobs and Youngstown was plunged into economic chaos."
"Ohio_Steel_14213_14231","The Apathy of USWA"
"Ohio_Steel_14233_14343","United Steel Workers of America was the union representing the Youngstown steel workers when the closings hit."
"Ohio_Steel_14344_14450","Initially many assumed that their union would take a lead role in fighting for the recovery of their jobs."
"Ohio_Steel_14451_14576","However, it soon became clear that although the local union leaders were prepared to fight, the international branch was not."
"Ohio_Steel_14577_14794","The higher levels of the union became increasingly disassociated with Youngstown and its plight, attempting to shut out the appeals from workers and local union representatives and to ignore what was really happening."
"Ohio_Steel_14796_14904","Actually, one main reason for the behavior of the USWA was that union leaders really had no idea what to do."
"Ohio_Steel_14905_15067","No one had ever seen a shutdown of this magnitude and rapidity before, and none of the leaders of USWA, not even president Lynn Williams, knew what could be done."
"Ohio_Steel_15068_15257","It was clear to everyone that the economic fallout from this series of closings would be one of the worst in US history, and so without any real precedents the union leaders were flustered."
"Ohio_Steel_15258_15480","Rather than try and come up with some sort of scenario, the USWA simply ignored what was going on in Youngstown, hoping that perhaps the problem would resolve itself, or at least not spread any further than it already had."
"Ohio_Steel_15482_15597","Besides incompetence, the USWA had one other major reason for rejecting their local counterpart: fear of socialism."
"Ohio_Steel_15598_15825","Obviously the union itself was not afraid of socialist action, but they worried that the federal government might see the efforts of Youngstown workers to collectivize as a movement towards socialism and perhaps even communism."
"Ohio_Steel_15826_16098","If the USWA supported the efforts to revive the mills and encouraged worker control and ownership of the factories, then the government (and potentially other important people and institutions as well) might begin to think that the UWSA leaders were encouraging socialism."
"Ohio_Steel_16099_16231","This would mean that UWSA would lose credibility with the American government and its people, something they could not afford to do."
"Ohio_Steel_16232_16320","Therefore, they decided to withdraw support and let the local branch fight it out alone."
"Ohio_Steel_16322_16333","Regionalism"
"Ohio_Steel_16335_16436","From its very first days the Mahoning Valley has been an area packed with small villages and hamlets."
"Ohio_Steel_16437_16613","Youngstown is the name of the major city area, but surrounding it on all sides are small communities which to the casual viewer are indistinguishable from the main city itself."
"Ohio_Steel_16614_16781","Boardman, Poland Township, Struthers, Lowellville, Warren, Lordstown, Canfield, Niles, and many other towns and districts are crowded around Youngstown (see Figure 3)."
"Ohio_Steel_16782_16925","People from each town work, shop, eat, and socialize in towns separate from their own, making each town strongly dependent on every other town."
"Ohio_Steel_16926_17097","However, although traffic is heavy between each separate district, each area has its own distinct cultural ethnicity, educational system, heritage, history, and even food."
"Ohio_Steel_17098_17291","For example, Struthers is a poor town with a large Slovak population, where education is generally better than in surrounding towns, but unemployment is much higher and pollution is widespread."
"Ohio_Steel_17292_17348","Most people in Struthers are either Orthodox or Baptist."
"Ohio_Steel_17349_17457","Two blocks over one finds Boardman, a well-off township with a reputation for rich but unsuccessful schools."
"Ohio_Steel_17458_17569","Its residents are mainly Italian and Roman Catholic, with a small concentration of Methodists on the east side."
"Ohio_Steel_17570_17668","Unemployment is low in comparison with surrounding towns, and the streets are clean and well kept."
"Ohio_Steel_17669_17824","With many more cultures, religions, and economic levels living in close proximity to one another, a curious phenomenon has overtaken the area: regionalism."
"Ohio_Steel_17825_18014","Each town, with their own identity, instills a strong regionalistic feeling within their respective populations, which dictates many habits, exchanges, and interactions between populations."
"Ohio_Steel_18015_18138","Oftentimes this regionalism takes the form of bizarre forms of hatred, with certain towns becoming sworn enemies of others."
"Ohio_Steel_18140_18288","With so much regional tension, it became very hard for workers to unite under a common cause, even one that would save their jobs and their futures."
"Ohio_Steel_18289_18516","Workers from Poland Township would refuse to attend rallies with workers from Campbell, and citizens of Struthers would become suspicious of people from Boardman, even if they were supposed to be working towards the same thing."
"Ohio_Steel_18517_18662","A lack of cooperation became a crippling problem for the movement, because no one was willing to put aside regional differences to work together."
"Ohio_Steel_18663_18885","In some instances, small companies would express interest in helping the movement or in relocating their business in the area, but because of regional pride no one could ever agree where the new businesses should relocate."
"Ohio_Steel_18886_19084","In this way the people of the Mahoning Valley missed many opportunities for new industrial or commercial lifeblood because of arbitrary arguments where the goal was simply to protect regional pride."
"Ohio_Steel_19086_19149","Conclusion: The Aftershock and the Significance of Black Monday"
"Ohio_Steel_19152_19222","Black Monday was a devastating blow to an entire generation of people."
"Ohio_Steel_19223_19652","The efforts to avoid catastrophe after the fact were unsuccessful for four main reasons: the failure of the international steel market, the lack of funds and plans in initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign, the refusal of the USWA to support their local chapter out of ineptitude and fear, and the absurd but very real regionalism which corrupted solidarity efforts and drove away any hope for brining in new companies."
"Ohio_Steel_19654_19778","What happened in Youngstown may not seem significant on an international or even on a national level, and perhaps it is not."
"Ohio_Steel_19779_19946","But to the thousands of people living there, the loss of the mills was a devastating event that sent shock waves through their economic, political, and social futures."
"Ohio_Steel_19947_20090","Because of the mills and their conspicuous absence, hundreds of people were uprooted, forced to leave their homes and tightly knit communities."
"Ohio_Steel_20091_20172","Hundreds more joined the unemployment lines, or even began living on the streets."
"Ohio_Steel_20173_20296","For the people of Youngstown, Black Monday was not just a historical event- it was the most important event in their lives."
"Ohio_Steel_20299_20483","The steel workers who tried to save their jobs and their lives were part of something greater than themselves, something which would endure long after they had moved away and moved on."
"Ohio_Steel_20484_20691","Even though they eventually failed, the fact that they tried to preserve what they felt belonged to them is an amazing example of how far people will go to save their lives and the futures of their children."
"cable_spool_fort_76_85","Hey, Roy?"
"cable_spool_fort_98_103","What?"
"cable_spool_fort_115_137","""You suck."" Chad said."
"cable_spool_fort_116_125","You suck."
"cable_spool_fort_138_216","He wished Roy wouldn't fall for that gag every time, ""get me a big rock, Roy."""
"cable_spool_fort_217_327","Roy stooped to pick up a big, white caliche rock that looked like a dirty lump of chalk and handed it to Chad."
"cable_spool_fort_328_400","Chad took the rock with disgust as Roy returned to staring at his shoes."
"cable_spool_fort_401_494","Chad was six, and at eight Roy should have been teasing or ordering Chad around or something."
"cable_spool_fort_495_581","But since his fall the year before, Roy had been shuffling and doing what he was told."
"cable_spool_fort_582_666","Chad strained and pounded the rock into the iron hole until he could smell the dust."
"cable_spool_fort_667_695","It smelled like first grade."
"cable_spool_fort_696_764","He wished he were there now, even if he did have to sit next to Roy."
"cable_spool_fort_765_950","The rock was too big to fit into the iron hub of the big cable spool, so Chad leaned it against the tumbleweed and slid down off the splintery wood on his belly to admire his handiwork."
"cable_spool_fort_961_1082","The fort was a lone, wooden cable spool like a tall barrel with thick disks on its ends, each the size of a dinner table."
"cable_spool_fort_1083_1151","Several boards were missing, making a door to the small room inside."
"cable_spool_fort_1152_1211","The tall tumbleweed flag marked it as Chad's to defend now."
"cable_spool_fort_1212_1257","He looked around, trying not to seem nervous."
"cable_spool_fort_1268_1356","The sky met the flat ground in all directions on the other side of the chain link fence."
"cable_spool_fort_1357_1414","Chad checked the other fort out of the corner of his eye."
"cable_spool_fort_1415_1493","Two forts stood on the playground, and a hot, bare battlefield separated them."
"cable_spool_fort_1494_1586","A massive, rusted A-frame swing marked the border though nobody was swinging in the hot sun."
"cable_spool_fort_1587_1737","The larger of the two forts was a squat black bunker made of tires, two big tractor tires capped with one from a truck and two smaller ones from cars."
"cable_spool_fort_1738_1801","The older boys lay around in shade and napped inside the walls."
"cable_spool_fort_1802_1930","They were watching now from well defended spy holes, or maybe they were performing secret experiments and swearing bloody oaths."
"cable_spool_fort_1931_1980","Chad wished he were old enough to be one of them."
"cable_spool_fort_1981_2044","Maybe Tucker would let him in after he saw Chad wasn't chicken."
"cable_spool_fort_2055_2090","""You wanna play robots?"" Roy asked."
"cable_spool_fort_2056_2078","You wanna play robots?"
"cable_spool_fort_2091_2154","Chad felt his heart beat a little faster and his cheeks burned."
"cable_spool_fort_2155_2251","He had invented the ""robots"" game to make fun of Roy, but Roy had never figured that out either."
"cable_spool_fort_2252_2279","It was Roy's favorite game."
"cable_spool_fort_2291_2316","No, go get some stickers."
"cable_spool_fort_2318_2445","Roy shuffled off without argument, his baseball cap pulled low to cover his bald head and brain plug and his shoe laces untied."
"cable_spool_fort_2446_2501","Roy had taught him to tie his shoes when Chad was five."
"cable_spool_fort_2502_2546","He thought about gathering stickers himself."
"cable_spool_fort_2547_2608","Roy was too slow, but he didn't dare step away from his fort."
"cable_spool_fort_2609_2727","He took another careful look over his shoulder and bent to pluck a yucca spear as if that were what drew his interest."
"cable_spool_fort_2728_2933","The long blade of the yucca had a sharp tip, but the only weapons allowed according to Humpty Dumpty Nursery rules of engagement were smelly thistles or cocklebur stems covered with spiked yellow stickers."
"cable_spool_fort_2934_3019","The tiny barbs hurt, but nobody was allowed to beat you up if you just used stickers."
"cable_spool_fort_3020_3185","The hot August sun was settling toward the time that Mrs. Rayburn would bring the milk tray out of the cinder block building where the toddlers and babies were kept."
"cable_spool_fort_3186_3244","The older boys wouldn't wait much longer before attacking."
"cable_spool_fort_3255_3337","Meanwhile Roy stalked around the fence edge bending to pick cockleburs as he went."
"cable_spool_fort_3338_3440","Every move Roy made since the accident was smooth and sudden and strange -- like a remote control boy."
"cable_spool_fort_3441_3605","When he saw Roy in the hospital with a shaved head and the small silver plug at the back of his noggin like a bottle cap, Chad had called him, ""Remote Control Boy."""
"cable_spool_fort_3606_3695","Momma had smacked Chad for saying it which hurt, and then she had cried, which was worse."
"cable_spool_fort_3696_3783","Pop had given Chad the sideways glance that promised hard labor when they made it home."
"cable_spool_fort_3784_3808","Chad just hung his head."
"cable_spool_fort_3809_3889","He knew it was too late to explain that he was trying to get a smile out of Roy."
"cable_spool_fort_3900_3970","Pop said, ""The doctors have put something very special in Roy's brain."
"cable_spool_fort_3911_3970","The doctors have put something very special in Roy's brain."
"cable_spool_fort_3971_4077","It's something they made for soldiers and astronauts and it's going to help Roy walk and talk to us again."
"cable_spool_fort_4079_4112","Pop put a hand on Roy's shoulder."
"cable_spool_fort_4114_4139","How are you feeling, Roy?"
"cable_spool_fort_4141_4220","Pop spoke slowly and Chad knew that he must have been practicing this with Roy."
"cable_spool_fort_4221_4311","They all stood around while the doctor made Roy shake and jerk and moan with a sick sound."
"cable_spool_fort_4312_4443","But the thing in his head hadn't worked yet because of something having to do with the, ""electric toads,"" which wouldn't, ""sit up."""
"cable_spool_fort_4444_4530","Roy didn't really start talking for days and didn't walk until a long time after that."
"cable_spool_fort_4531_4606","Now, this year, Roy was in the same grade as Chad, and it was embarrassing."
"cable_spool_fort_4617_4678","Roy stepped around the edge of the building and out of sight."
"cable_spool_fort_4679_4779","Just then Tucker Williams came climbing out of the top of the black fort like a gold headed monster."
"cable_spool_fort_4780_4876","Tucker was big, even for a third grader, and he was not quite right in a different way than Roy."
"cable_spool_fort_4877_4968","Tucker was the oldest boy in the playground, and the one who decided the rules of the game."
"cable_spool_fort_4979_4990","""Time out!"""
"cable_spool_fort_4980_5025","Time out!"" Chad called, ""We're not ready yet."
"cable_spool_fort_5005_5025","We're not ready yet."
"cable_spool_fort_5037_5106","""No time outs!"" Tucker shouted and continued to climb down the tires."
"cable_spool_fort_5037_5052","""No time outs!"""
"cable_spool_fort_5107_5146","Several more boys spewed out after him."
"cable_spool_fort_5158_5209","Roy!"" Chad called, but his voice would only whisper"
"cable_spool_fort_5158_5162","Roy!"
"cable_spool_fort_5211_5266","He didn't want to be a crybaby, Tucker hated crybabies."
"cable_spool_fort_5267_5378","The rules of the game were that Chad had to keep everyone away from his fort and away from his tumbleweed flag."
"cable_spool_fort_5379_5504","From painful experience, he knew it wasn't going to be as easy as just pretending he was too slow or too weak to do anything."
"cable_spool_fort_5505_5551","Tucker liked to hit and he liked to see blood."
"cable_spool_fort_5552_5725","Going down too easy would only make him mad, so Chad reached behind him to grab the five stickers he had managed to collect before the start of the game and readied himself."
"cable_spool_fort_5736_5903","The boys came in quick from all sides, knocking Chad down, but he managed to roll to his feet and get one sticker off into a boy's arm before being knocked down again."
"cable_spool_fort_5915_5920","Baby!"
"cable_spool_fort_5922_5997","Tucker was standing over him with the huge tumbleweed held high in the sun."
"cable_spool_fort_5999_6005","Penis!"
"cable_spool_fort_6006_6023","You didn't fight!"
"cable_spool_fort_6035_6148","Chad tried to tell his arms to lift him and let him reach for the tumbleweed to prove he wasn't a baby to Tucker."
"cable_spool_fort_6149_6266","But as much as he wanted to appease the scary, staring, angry boy, he couldn't move for fear of what was coming next."
"cable_spool_fort_6278_6298","I'll make you fight."
"cable_spool_fort_6300_6371","Tucker leaned in low and his breath was sour as it blew in Chad's face."
"cable_spool_fort_6373_6401","I'm gonna take the plug out."
"cable_spool_fort_6403_6437","Then Tucker's face became serious."
"cable_spool_fort_6438_6503","The awesomeness of what he intended pulling his eyes wider still."
"cable_spool_fort_6504_6593","From his pocket he pulled a small screwdriver, perfect for prying plugs from boy's heads."
"cable_spool_fort_6604_6710","Now Chad's legs and arms and mouth worked, and he was up and running and screaming, ""Roy, go inside! Roy!"""
"cable_spool_fort_6689_6704","Roy, go inside!"
"cable_spool_fort_6705_6709","Roy!"
"cable_spool_fort_6711_6787","He sprinted for the corner of the building around which Roy had disappeared."
"cable_spool_fort_6788_6831","The door was on that side and Mrs. Rayburn."
"cable_spool_fort_6832_6894","Just then a horrible pain stung Chad's cheek and neck and ear."
"cable_spool_fort_6895_6981","The tumbleweed's yellow thorned branches scratched around him as it dug into his face."
"cable_spool_fort_6982_7062","Tucker made a grab for him but missed it, and Chad heard his shirt rip a little."
"cable_spool_fort_7063_7156","He ran like only a small boy can run, but he was losing and he wished hard that he could fly."
"cable_spool_fort_7168_7172","Roy!"
"cable_spool_fort_7174_7350","Chad rounded the corner grabbing the cinder block to help him turn faster just as Tucker came down again with the tumbleweed from behind, and the world slowed almost to a stop."
"cable_spool_fort_7361_7401","Roy stood with the bill of his cap down."
"cable_spool_fort_7402_7458","His head rose and his eyes focused over Chad's shoulder."
"cable_spool_fort_7459_7567","Roy held stickers in his hand like flowers, but he bent looking down and snatched something from the ground."
"cable_spool_fort_7568_7621","His hand blurred and snapped out as he stood back up."
"cable_spool_fort_7622_7717","Something whined as it spun past Chad's ear, and he heard a sharp, meaty thunk just behind him."
"cable_spool_fort_7728_7784","Roy stood expressionless as ever as Chad turned to look."
"cable_spool_fort_7785_7961","Tucker towered there with a surprised expression and crossed eyes, the tumbleweed in one hand and the screwdriver held up high in the other ready to stab down into Chad's back."
"cable_spool_fort_7962_8142","A sharp, flat, flint rock split Tucker's forehead and was buried deep and solid like a part of a Halloween costume complete with a drop of blood just starting down toward his nose."
"cable_spool_fort_8153_8199","Tucker dropped down like a jacket from a hook."
"cable_spool_fort_8200_8278","He lay folded over his own lap in a way that made Chad think of broken things."
"cable_spool_fort_8290_8297","You ok?"
"cable_spool_fort_8299_8394","It was Roy, and when Chad looked up there was something like his brother there around the eyes."
"cable_spool_fort_8406_8411","Yeah."
"cable_spool_fort_8413_8465","Chad stepped back away from Tucker's open-eyed face."
"cable_spool_fort_8467_8504","He was gonna take off your head plug."
"cable_spool_fort_8516_8674","""I thought he might stab you."" Roy said and craned his neck forward to look at Tucker's face as the other boys began to crowd around at a respectful distance."
"cable_spool_fort_8517_8545","I thought he might stab you."
"cable_spool_fort_8676_8699","Do you think he's dead?"
"cable_spool_fort_8711_8753","Just then Tucker blinked and began to sob."
"cable_spool_fort_8754_8800","""Nah."" Chad said, ""We're gonna be in trouble."""
"cable_spool_fort_8755_8759","Nah."
"cable_spool_fort_8773_8799","We're gonna be in trouble."
"cable_spool_fort_8811_8828","""Yeah."" Roy said."
"cable_spool_fort_8812_8817","Yeah."
"cable_spool_fort_8829_8846","Then he shrugged."
"cable_spool_fort_8847_8928","Suddenly his blank face seemed like the face of a Play Force Soldier or a GI Joe."
"cable_spool_fort_8940_8949","Hey, Roy?"
"cable_spool_fort_8962_8967","What?"
"cable_spool_fort_8980_8989","You suck."
"cable_spool_fort_8991_9069","Chad finished the formula, but this time, he didn't mind that Roy fell for it."
"cable_spool_fort_9070_9087","It was all right."

"captured_moments_638_754","I remember Papa's stopbox, a teal blue Tiempo Capturado that Mama brought home for his birthday."
"captured_moments_755_897","It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it."
"captured_moments_898_1100","He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter."
"captured_moments_1101_1281","Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection."
"captured_moments_1282_1496","Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it."
"captured_moments_1515_1625","When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment."
"captured_moments_1626_1673","We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes."
"captured_moments_1674_1777","I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play."
"captured_moments_1778_1968","One night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox."
"captured_moments_1969_2149","Bringing my face close to the shoes, I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing up that symbol of their love for me."
"captured_moments_2168_2281","The instant would have been improved had my baby shoes been cleaned before they were encased."
"captured_moments_2282_2383","But as soon as I coughed, I laughed, and I did not try to kill myself that night."
"captured_moments_2427_2446","Let me begin again."
"captured_moments_2491_2605","I like life on the resort worlds -- always have and, after the upcoming mindwipe, always will."
"captured_moments_2606_2847","Last year, I rented a small house on Vega IV, a sea world, all islands and reefs and archipelagos, turquoise waters and aquamarine skies, sunrises like symphonies and sunsets like stars gone supernova."
"captured_moments_2848_3009","There's only one city: called Nuevo Acapulco in La Enciclopedia del Empirio de la Humanidad, it's N'apulco to the locals."
"captured_moments_3010_3212","The N'apulcans are mostly emigrants from Polaris II; the only difference between them and their Carribbean ancestors is that the ancestors fleeced NorAm tourists."
"captured_moments_3213_3288","Now the N'apulcans profit from their Hispanic siblings."
"captured_moments_3307_3337","I don't mean to sound cynical."
"captured_moments_3338_3480","I suppose I wish to show that I'm still capable of a certain authorial distance, a semblance of dispassionate observation."
"captured_moments_3481_3545","The following events may indicate otherwise."
"captured_moments_3564_3623","In fine tourist tradition, most homes on Vega IV are named."
"captured_moments_3624_3712","Mine was The Sleeping Flamingo, and its outer walls were coral pink."
"captured_moments_3713_3806","Were they mood-sensitive, they would have changed as I first viewed them."
"captured_moments_3807_3939","The rental agent, an attractive N'apulcan named Tasha Cortez, was not mood-sensitive either."
"captured_moments_3940_3990","She said, ""It's beautiful, isn't it, Señor Flynn?"""
"captured_moments_3950_3990","""It's beautiful, isn't it, Señor Flynn?"""
"captured_moments_4009_4132","My instinct was to gesture curtly with a cupped hand that she lift the wind boat and take me elsewhere."
"captured_moments_4133_4359","But she was young and attractive (as I have said and may say again) and eager and so happy to be assisting the infamous Bernardo Flynn that I merely raised an eyebrow in mild scepticism."
"captured_moments_4360_4519","And then, because a playwright cannot resist a promising line, I said, ""Your Sleeping Flamingo should be put to sleep."""
"captured_moments_4451_4519","""Your Sleeping Flamingo should be put to sleep."""
"captured_moments_4538_4608","To say her face fell would do a disservice to Tasha and to literature."
"captured_moments_4609_4892","(Allow me my self-indulgences as you would those of a dying man -- when I convince my mindsmith to permit the wipe, there will be another Bernardo Flynn, one who knows no more of Tasha Cortez or Vega IV than he reads here.)"
"captured_moments_4893_5084","Her brows drew together, creasing the lovely, caramel-colored skin around her eyes and showing the pattern for an old woman's wrinkles on her forehead."
"captured_moments_5085_5254","Her lower lip (a trifle too narrow for her face, perhaps her only physical flaw) thrust forward slightly as she started to speak."
"captured_moments_5255_5371","She caught herself, slid her jaw infinitesimally back into place, and said, ""You don't like it?"""
"captured_moments_5351_5371","""You don't like it?"""
"captured_moments_5390_5400","I laughed."
"captured_moments_5401_5417","What could I do?"
"captured_moments_5418_5495","I clapped her shoulder to show I was not laughing at her."
"captured_moments_5496_5505","""Like it?"
"captured_moments_5506_5538","I hate it, despise it, abhor it!"
"captured_moments_5539_5648","It's gaudy, graceless, pretentious -- That house is an affront to taste and intelligence."
"captured_moments_5649_5726","I should buy it to raze it, but I am not so kind-hearted."
"captured_moments_5727_5754","I might, however, rent it."""
"captured_moments_5773_5824","I think she only heard the last words of my speech."
"captured_moments_5825_5836","""You will?"""
"captured_moments_5855_5869","""It amuses me."
"captured_moments_5870_5911","Show me around, and then I shall decide."""
"captured_moments_5930_5955","""Of course, Señor Flynn."""
"captured_moments_5974_6003","""And stop calling me 'señor'."
"captured_moments_6004_6037","Not even Los Mundos is so polite."
"captured_moments_6038_6076","Call me Bernardo."""
"captured_moments_6095_6109","""If you wish."""
"captured_moments_6128_6190","""I beg you, change the color of the walls, at the very least."""
"captured_moments_6209_6225","""But of course!"""
"captured_moments_6226_6272","The house walls shifted from pink to lavender."
"captured_moments_6291_6300","I stared."
"captured_moments_6319_6332","""How's that?"""
"captured_moments_6351_6367","I looked at her."
"captured_moments_6386_6394","""Worse?"""
"captured_moments_6413_6422","I nodded."
"captured_moments_6423_6462","""I would not have thought it possible."""
"captured_moments_6481_6493","She frowned."
"captured_moments_6494_6514","""It is rather ugly."""
"captured_moments_6533_6575","""Thoroughly ugly,"" I corrected with smile."
"captured_moments_6533_6551","""Thoroughly ugly,"""
"captured_moments_6594_6634","""Obscenely ugly,"" said she, smiling too."
"captured_moments_6594_6611","""Obscenely ugly,"""
"captured_moments_6653_6658","""No."""
"captured_moments_6659_6669","I pointed."
"captured_moments_6670_6688","""It has no tower."""
"captured_moments_6707_6724","""I can fix that."""
"captured_moments_6725_6776","She reached for another dial on the house controls."
"captured_moments_6795_6812","""Don't you dare!"""
"captured_moments_6813_6908","Her wrist, when I grabbed it, was smooth and strong and warm in my fingers."
"captured_moments_6909_6923","""I'll take it."
"captured_moments_6924_6942","Exactly as it is."""
"captured_moments_6961_6972","""You will?"""
"captured_moments_6991_6999","""I must."
"captured_moments_7000_7040","God knows what you might do to it next."""
"captured_moments_7041_7094","Reluctantly, I released her hand."
"captured_moments_7113_7165","The interior of The Flamingo was a welcome surprise."
"captured_moments_7166_7320","Cloudwood had been used in a Mediterranean manner, making the house seem primitive and civilized at the same time."
"captured_moments_7321_7380","The kitchen and baths had every convenience that I desired."
"captured_moments_7381_7526","From the living room, the view of the beach struck me with such intensity that Tasha asked if I felt ill."
"captured_moments_7527_7552","All I could say was, ""No."
"captured_moments_7548_7552","""No."
"captured_moments_7553_7566","I'm in love."""
"captured_moments_7567_7627","We both thought I referred to the vista."
"captured_moments_7672_7973","It's strange how one can write delightedly of the happier moments of life, forgetting the things that one would forget by remembering fully the things one would remember, and suddenly the forgotten, in revenge, rears up to savage the unwary."
"captured_moments_7974_8009","So it was as I wrote the preceding."
"captured_moments_8010_8099","My heart convulsed, and I left this manuscript for a three-day spree."
"captured_moments_8100_8184","Apparently I was so successful that it lasted a week and a half."
"captured_moments_8185_8287","Not bad for an eighty-three-year-old, even for one who has his rejuve every month."
"captured_moments_8288_8406","And if I can brag and digress so easily, this must not be painful enough to merit a mindwipe, yes?"
"captured_moments_8425_8428","No."
"captured_moments_8429_8685","I abandoned these notes to my future self to have the wipe done immediately, thinking that Bernardo Flynn should receive such services when he needed them, even should the need arise at the third hour after midnight."
"captured_moments_8686_8743","My mindsmith is not so understanding."
"captured_moments_8744_8828","She says I am emotionally a child, to which I reply, ""Of course."
"captured_moments_8797_8828","""Of course."
"captured_moments_8829_8859","Why else would I come to you?"""

"captured_moments_9157_9268","I hope the wipe is as successful with my time on Vega IV as my spree was with my time here."
"captured_moments_9269_9382","I dimly remember three bedpartners who were probably human, and one that I hope was delirium."
"captured_moments_9383_9478","I will not answer the phone for a week, no matter whose face appears on it."
"captured_moments_9497_9522","I keep evading the issue."
"captured_moments_9523_9539","But which issue?"
"captured_moments_9540_9621","The issue of why I am evading the issue, or the issue itself?"
"captured_moments_9622_9667","To deal with the first: it hurts to remember."
"captured_moments_9668_9734","If I am capable of love, I loved Tasha Cortez."
"captured_moments_9735_9811","If I am not, I had the perfect mirror for my narcissism."
"captured_moments_9830_9896","As for the issue itself, I'm no longer sure what I want to record."
"captured_moments_9897_9977","The playwright in me wants every scene of our time together."
"captured_moments_9978_10047","The editor says no, only those that are relevant."
"captured_moments_10048_10121","The sufferer says no, only those which cause no pain."
"captured_moments_10122_10243","And the artist says no, only those which cause the most pain, for those would be the truest memories."

"captured_moments_10320_10425","I will not talk of the first time Tasha and I tried any act of sex or sport together."

"captured_moments_12539_12758","But the truth is that Tasha pointed it out from the one place where it could barely be seen, and I only felt envy that it had been designed by someone with understated good taste."

"captured_moments_13277_13416","I made some small joke afterward, about approving of her firm's business incentives, and she cried."
"captured_moments_13417_13463","Consoling her, I began to suspect I loved her."
"captured_moments_13464_13603","I moved into The Flamingo the next day; and she gave up her apartment three weeks later to join me."
"captured_moments_13604_13851","It was the sort of romance that happens so rarely that most people believe it does not happen at all, the sort of romance that sustains the hopeless billions who regularly watch A Wandering Star Called Love."
"captured_moments_13852_13915","(Which is to say, you and me, Future Self.)"
"captured_moments_13934_13955","Who was Tasha Cortez?"
"captured_moments_13956_14139","She was a twenty-four-year-old (Terran Standard) N'Apulcan who left university training in hydroponics to work for her aunt's real estate firm."
"captured_moments_14140_14271","Her family said she did it to support her father, who was dying of a particularly painful degenerative disease."
"captured_moments_14272_14429","Tasha said she woke up one morning convinced that if she spent another day studying vegetables, she would become one."
"captured_moments_14448_14474","She did not like my plays."
"captured_moments_14475_14602","I had impressed her because I was famous and amusing and not, as I had hoped, because I was a great artist."
"captured_moments_14603_14748","That bothered (yes, and intrigued) me until I realized that she was bored by most plays, movies, and vid."
"captured_moments_14749_14784","She did not like being a spectator."
"captured_moments_14785_14908","I often told her that she should have a bio-check to see if she suffered from some metabolic imbalance."
"captured_moments_14909_14962","I often told her too many things."
"captured_moments_14981_15103","Search ""Emiliano Malaquez"" and you'll find he's a master of the ""captured moment"" school of sculpture."
"captured_moments_15104_15155","Even The Terran Times has only praise for his work."
"captured_moments_15176_15279","To compare his pieces to those of others is to compare mannequins to living models."
"captured_moments_15280_15505","He accents the illusion of reality --I paraphrase his entry in La Enciclopedia Humanica --by doing life-size scenes in ""the full round,"" never the easier frontal or three-quarters view."
"captured_moments_15506_15668","Moreover, he never did portraits of famous people; his works were therefore the reality and could never be compared to it."
"captured_moments_15669_15733","As is typical of his school, his pieces are sealed in stopboxes."
"captured_moments_15734_15903","The shimmer of light on their surfaces always reminds us that we're looking at an instant snatched from under the hooves of time."
"captured_moments_15904_16123","They say the cubes will outlast planets and suns, that when the universe dies, the works of Malaquez and his followers will be the last things seen in the final wink of God's eye."
"captured_moments_16142_16379","Yes, Self, I am also bothered that this observation ignores half-eaten cheese sandwiches, incomplete insect collections, and locks of infants' hair, forgotten in closets, basements, and warehouses."

"captured_moments_16462_16601","The mindwipe will take its creation from my future self --but time too often does that without aid."

"captured_moments_16696_16796","I have disguised us in the play, and deleted one brief melodramatic interchange."
"captured_moments_16797_16855","Now I will mention it, in case I/You decide to restore it."
"captured_moments_16856_16952","Shortly before she left, Tasha said, ""You steal from life for art, Bernardo."

"captured_moments_25336_25454","I stopped writing, and only the thought that I might miss the mindwipe kept me from another spree."
"captured_moments_25455_25558","I went walking, but after N'apulco, Rio seems no fit abode for a creature of flesh."
"captured_moments_25559_25709","I walked from this hotel to the old city, past the end of the slidewalks and softwalks to the hard, cracked pavement of City Park."
"captured_moments_25710_25760","But Undersiders left me alone."
"captured_moments_25761_25800","Perhaps they recognized a fellow ghost."
"captured_moments_25801_25891","So I returned, and slept, and now the mindwipe is thirteen hours away."
"captured_moments_25936_26048","The side of Malaquez's parcel gave way to reveal a greenmunk caught in a sheen of solid air."
"captured_moments_26049_26161","Bits of leaf mold flew from under his feet as he ran to greet a friend or a bringer of food."
"captured_moments_26162_26181","Tasha oohed in awe."
"captured_moments_26182_26242","I said, ""Frodo's been visiting you, eh?"""
"captured_moments_26190_26242","""Frodo's been visiting you, eh?"""

"captured_moments_28327_28380","Perhaps the two of you together?"""
"captured_moments_28399_28526","Her eyes became circles at the idea of being, as she undoubtedly thought it, immortalized by Emil Malaquez."
"captured_moments_28527_28752","Catching herself, she said casually, ""Oh..."" And then she smiled, laughed loudly at herself in the way that always made me think how much I loved her, and said, ""My God, yes, yes, yes!"""
"captured_moments_28564_28571","""Oh..."""
"captured_moments_28728_28752","""My God, yes, yes, yes!"""
"captured_moments_28753_28863","For a perfect moment, Emil and Tasha and I were one entity, laughing until our lungs hurt."
"captured_moments_28882_28898","This is torture."
"captured_moments_28899_28994","I had not considered that I might not write to learn, but to punish myself."
"captured_moments_28995_29344","Let me abuse the playwright and dismiss the penultimate scene in a few sentences: After giving Emil full rights to a sculpture of Tasha and me, we had a good dinner of curried clam chowder, lobsters boiled on Terra and unstopped still steaming on N'Apulco, and cinnamon custard for desert."
"captured_moments_29345_29398","Then we went out for a late swim."
"captured_moments_29417_29468","I had drunk too much, I confess, though we all had."
"captured_moments_29469_29618","Somehow, Tasha and I began to argue the worth of Solevgrad jazz, as inconsequential a topic as I can imagine."
"captured_moments_29619_29685","She had studied it in school, so she thought herself as an expert."
"captured_moments_29686_29823","I once had a neighbor who played it constantly, loudly, and badly, so I thought I knew it better."
"captured_moments_29824_29886","Malaquez tried to mediate, but I saw him as siding with Tasha."
"captured_moments_29907_29928","So, I think, did she."
"captured_moments_29929_30046","The subject shifted from music to Tasha's obsession with fame, undoubtedly by a leap that I made."
"captured_moments_30047_30079","She had no choice but to follow."
"captured_moments_30080_30164","(I do not remember any of this well, just now, nor do I care to."

"captured_moments_30467_30509","Tasha looked at me as if to say, ""I will."""
"captured_moments_30500_30509","""I will."""

"captured_moments_30624_30634","""Do that,"""
"captured_moments_30692_30723","Emil asked, ""You're all right?"""
"captured_moments_30704_30723","""You're all right?"""
"captured_moments_30724_30800","I muttered something he must have interpreted as assent."
"captured_moments_30801_30918","They both walked up to Emil's home while I watched the scarlet moonlight ripple on distant waves."
"captured_moments_30919_31124","Disgusted with Tasha but more disgusted with myself, I finally realized she would not return that night and went into The Sleeping Flamingo to drink myself to sleep."
"captured_moments_31143_31192","She had not come home when I woke in mid-morning."
"captured_moments_31193_31401","I waited, and drank a glass of MorningAfter and three cups of coffee, and wondered whether our affair could survive the events of the night, and whether I wanted it to."
"captured_moments_31402_31557","Perhaps I should have invited Emil to stay, but even then I knew that sex was not the problem between Tasha and me."
"captured_moments_31558_31696","The problem was that I have trouble distinguishing between compromise and capitulation, between symbols and substance."
"captured_moments_31697_31886","Shortly before noon, I climbed the sandy path to Dream's End, rehearsing my apology, slowing only to pluck burrs from between my sandals and my feet."
"captured_moments_31905_31975","Malaquez answered the door in blood-red pajamas and a black silk robe."
"captured_moments_31976_32079","Sixty years ago in a similar situation, I had broken my knuckles on someone's face."
"captured_moments_32080_32131","I merely said, ""Is Tasha here?"""
"captured_moments_32115_32131","""Is Tasha here?"""
"captured_moments_32150_32191","He pursed his lips slightly, then nodded."
"captured_moments_32192_32198","""Yes."""
"captured_moments_32217_32233","""May I see her?"""
"captured_moments_32234_32286","When he hesitated, I said, ""Last night was my fault."
"captured_moments_32261_32286","""Last night was my fault."
"captured_moments_32287_32340","I hold it against neither of you."
"captured_moments_32341_32348","Please."
"captured_moments_32349_32369","Let me talk to her."""
"captured_moments_32388_32394","""I --"""
"captured_moments_32413_32422","""Please."""
"captured_moments_32441_32484","He looked me and at last said, ""Very well."""
"captured_moments_32472_32484","""Very well."""
"captured_moments_32503_32542","We walked through his house in silence."
"captured_moments_32543_32660","It was as attractive and as impersonal as a decorator could arrange for tenants of unknown taste."
"captured_moments_32661_32841","A tall, narrow stopbox stood in the center of one room; sand trickled forever downward while beads of water splashed across the sand's path."
"captured_moments_32842_32918","If that was Malaquez's work, it was a very minor effort."
"captured_moments_32919_32962","But then, I was in no mood to consider art."
"captured_moments_32963_33044","I only wanted to despise the man who had slept with my lover."
"captured_moments_33045_33103","That was easier than despising myself."
"captured_moments_33122_33154","He paused before a bedroom door."
"captured_moments_33155_33177","""I should go in first."
"captured_moments_33178_33194","To prepare her."""
"captured_moments_33213_33222","I smiled."
"captured_moments_33223_33264","""She handles surprise surprisingly well."""
"captured_moments_33283_33304","""What would it hurt?"""
"captured_moments_33323_33329","""True."
"captured_moments_33330_33339","Go ahead."
"captured_moments_33340_33352","Tell her..."""
"captured_moments_33353_33364","I shrugged."
"captured_moments_33365_33387","""Tell her I love her."""
"captured_moments_33406_33478","He studied me, then said, ""I'm sorry things happened this way, Bernardo."

"captured_moments_33479_33533","I didn't anticipate last night --"""
"captured_moments_33552_33600","""I'm very good at making things happen this way."
"captured_moments_33601_33653","But if Tasha will forgive me --"""
"captured_moments_33672_33739","He nodded, repeated, ""I am sorry,"" then slipped into the next room."
"captured_moments_33693_33706","""I am sorry,"""
"captured_moments_33740_33796","I waited in the dark, carpeted hall."
"captured_moments_33797_33843","A warm breeze came from silent vents above me."
"captured_moments_33844_33911","I heard no voices until Malaquez said, ""Enter."""
"captured_moments_33903_33911","""Enter."""
"captured_moments_33930_33963","I blinked when I opened the door."
"captured_moments_33964_33999","Sunlight filled Malaquez's bedroom."
"captured_moments_34000_34061","Tasha lay sprawled nude on a rumpled bed."
"captured_moments_34062_34148","Her skin seemed as smooth and as polished as the bed's teak frame."
"captured_moments_34149_34268","She was looking slightly to my left, smiling with trust and satisfaction like one sexually content."
"captured_moments_34269_34345","Malaquez stood near her, pointing something at my chest."
"captured_moments_34346_34444","Though the morning sun shone fully on both of them, it shimmered around Tasha."
"captured_moments_34463_34599","The part of my mind that remembered four months in NorAm during the Great Cleaning sent me rolling across the floor."
"captured_moments_34600_34866","Malaquez was not prepared for me to react so quickly, or perhaps he waited too long for an expression I would not have, a gesture I would not make, a poignant moment of repentence, wonder, despair, or love."
"captured_moments_34867_34910","Had he been faster, he could have had rage."
"captured_moments_34911_34954","I threw a chair at him."
"captured_moments_34955_35064","As he fell, I scrambled onto him, my knees pinning his arms, my fingers probing his neck."
"captured_moments_35083_35108","I shouted, ""Where is she?"
"captured_moments_35094_35108","""Where is she?"
"captured_moments_35109_35134","Tell me, or I'll kill --"""
"captured_moments_35153_35169","He began to cry."
"captured_moments_35170_35180","""She left."
"captured_moments_35181_35205","Earlier this morning --"""
"captured_moments_35224_35270","Her clothes lay by the cube enclosing the bed."
"captured_moments_35271_35326","I hit him with the back of my hand."
"captured_moments_35327_35347","""Tell me, Malaquez."""
"captured_moments_35366_35391","""She wanted to be famous."
"captured_moments_35392_35400","She did!"
"captured_moments_35401_35418","Now she will be."""
"captured_moments_35437_35474","He seemed to expect me to understand."
"captured_moments_35475_35483","""Where!"""
"captured_moments_35484_35592","I demanded, squeezing his throat until he began jerking his head madly at the sculpture."
"captured_moments_35611_35639","I stared at the naked Tasha."
"captured_moments_35640_35817","Most of his story I have pieced together since, but I understood enough as I knelt on his chest with my hands tight on his fleshy throat."
"captured_moments_35818_35862","He had made his name with a home capturador."
"captured_moments_35863_35987","He began with small animals and moved on to derelicts and Undersiders, people who would never be missed."
"captured_moments_35988_36172","Now he had thought to use vacationers like Tasha and me, and when someone came looking, he would say we had gone island-hopping in our windboat."
"captured_moments_36173_36280","Our boat would disappear into the ocean to be found or not as the wind and tides chose."
"captured_moments_36281_36338","His story would stand in either case."
"captured_moments_36357_36464","I wanted him to tell me more, but he babbled, begging me to forgive him, to understand."
"captured_moments_36465_36482","I did not listen."
"captured_moments_36483_36658","I took the capturador, a matte black Tiempo Capturado, from his grip and studied it, not really thinking about it or Malaquez or Tasha."
"captured_moments_36659_36771","I think I was wondering what it meant to say that a thing was art, so we accepted it as art."
"captured_moments_36772_36885","Or perhaps I was thinking about the things that humanity made that would outlive our species."
"captured_moments_36886_36980","But I was probably only looking at my reflection in the capturador's lens."
"captured_moments_36981_37063","Had he said then that I should use it on myself, I might have."
"captured_moments_37082_37101","That moment passed."
"captured_moments_37102_37123","I looked at Malaquez."
"captured_moments_37124_37194","His eyes opened wider while we watched each other."
"captured_moments_37195_37263","His lips contorted as if they had lost their ability to shape sound."
"captured_moments_37284_37334","I turned to touch the cube that was Tasha's crypt."
"captured_moments_37335_37489","She smiled in trust or pleasure or pride, an erotic Mona Lisa who would smile forever, and I could never know why."
"captured_moments_37508_37640","The controls of the capturador were more complex than those of a kitchen model, but I recognized the unstop tab."
"captured_moments_37641_37660","I could free Tasha."
"captured_moments_37661_37724","If I did, one of three things would happen."
"captured_moments_37725_37842","Most likely: she would be meat --there is a reason why stopboxes are most often used in kitchens."
"captured_moments_37843_37953","Less likely: she would live the rest of her days with a mind as free of worry as a slug's."
"captured_moments_37954_38161","And the tiniest chance of all: she would blink as if I had just materialized in Emil's bedroom, and then she would laugh and tell me that she was going to be immortal."
"captured_moments_38180_38297","As I put my hand on the impervious surface of Tasha's stopbox, I heard Malaquez run for the door."
"captured_moments_38316_38426","It is strange to know that we can do acts of unrepayable kindness to those we should hate."
"captured_moments_38427_38583","Know this, my future self: Thanks to us, Emil Malaquez's name will live as long as his masterpiece, ""A Self-Portrait: Anguish,"" endures."
"captured_moments_38602_38612","And Tasha?"
"captured_moments_38613_38681","I could say that I did not dare to take responsibility for her fate."
"captured_moments_38702_38864","I could say that I chose out of consideration for her desire for fame; some critics already say ""Waking With Tasha"" is Malaquez's finest work."
"captured_moments_38865_39040","If science finds a way to safely free the subjects of Emil's art, perhaps the I who reads this file will know that my decision is wise."
"captured_moments_39041_39153","But I cannot stop thinking that I was never afraid of losing Tasha to brain damage or death."
"captured_moments_39154_39355","My fear is that she would live, and I would learn that I had lost her long before Emil Malaquez translated her into a thing that can be kept, admired, and loved."
"captured_moments_39374_39416","For in my way, I have done the same thing."
"captured_moments_39435_39467","I am ready for the mindwipe now."
"easy_money_65_129","Charles Acres called me on a Thursday afternoon, just like that."
"easy_money_130_239","I hadn't seen him since high-school, maybe twenty years before, and we were never buddies in the first place."
"easy_money_240_287","He said he had a ""business proposition"" for me."
"easy_money_288_327","So I'm thinking ""Amway,"" and I said so."
"easy_money_328_425","He sounded surprised and said no, he needed me to help him get rid of ""a large quantity of gold."""
"easy_money_426_499","I told him I'd meet him for coffee at the diner down the street at seven."
"easy_money_500_518","I was there early."
"easy_money_529_554","Thank you for coming, Ed."
"easy_money_556_635","he was already there, sitting in a booth, warming his hands on a cup of coffee."
"easy_money_636_675","He looked like jerked meat on the bone."
"easy_money_676_793","He was wearing a new jacket and snow boots, but he had on a Hawaiian shirt underneath and khaki shorts of all things."
"easy_money_794_895","His tan was obviously deep and old, but it looked like a work tan, not the kind you get at the beach."
"easy_money_896_957","His hands were thin and huge knuckled with obvious callouses."
"easy_money_968_1033","So, the mining business is treating you pretty good, huh Charles?"
"easy_money_1035_1073","he wasn't the sort you'd call ""Chuck."""
"easy_money_1085_1117","'m a linguistics researcher, Ed."
"easy_money_1119_1211","He took a sip and closed his eyes like the cheap cup of coffee was really something special."
"easy_money_1213_1283","Well I was a researcher, and I taught a little at a community college."
"easy_money_1285_1350","He set the cup down and looked straight at me for the first time."
"easy_money_1352_1378","How's your um... business?"
"easy_money_1390_1395","Fine."
"easy_money_1397_1468","I waived down a waitress and ordered a cup of decaf and a slice of pie."
"easy_money_1469_1497","I didn't like his tone much."
"easy_money_1498_1538","""So you sure you're not a cop, Charles?"""
"easy_money_1539_1575","I stared him down until he flinched."
"easy_money_1576_1637","As I did, I noticed just how tired he looked around the eyes."
"easy_money_1638_1690","Charlie Boy had been working hard lately, I figured."
"easy_money_1691_1825","I knew every cop in Fairport and quite a few of the state police in Iowa, and I couldn't see them bringing old Charles in as a ringer."
"easy_money_1837_1849","'m not a cop"
"easy_money_1852_1925","He sighed and went on in softer, sadder voice, ""I guess I'm a thief now."""
"easy_money_1936_1944","Hold it."
"easy_money_1946_1962","I looked around."
"easy_money_1963_2039","Charles might be for real, but he was still going to get me in deep trouble."
"easy_money_2041_2101","Let's make real clear right now that you were joking, buddy."
"easy_money_2102_2138","Otherwise this conversation is over."
"easy_money_2139_2224","I've got a parole officer to explain things to, and he wouldn't like that kinda talk."
"easy_money_2236_2242","Right."
"easy_money_2243_2249","Right."
"easy_money_2250_2256","Sorry."
"easy_money_2258_2347","Charles looked out the window at the passing traffic push through dirty slush for awhile."
"easy_money_2349_2367","Like I was saying."
"easy_money_2368_2516","I'm a researcher, I've come into some valuable material that I would like to find a buyer for, and I don't want to have to explain myself to anyone."
"easy_money_2527_2608","The pie came and I waited until the waitress was gone, before going on, ""Why me?"""
"easy_money_2618_2683","""You always seemed to have 'connections' in school,"" he shrugged."
"easy_money_2685_2728","You were the first person who came to mind."
"easy_money_2739_2752","First person?"
"easy_money_2753_2785","Twenty years out of high school?"
"easy_money_2786_2835","If he pulled my leg any harder it was coming off."
"easy_money_2837_2895","How much of this 'valuable material' are we talking about?"
"easy_money_2907_2939","Four Hundred ounces for a start."
"easy_money_2951_2964","Four Hundred."
"easy_money_2966_3016","I pulled out my palm phone and looked up a number."
"easy_money_3018_3030","That's alot."
"easy_money_3042_3088","It's a very small part of what I have to sell."
"easy_money_3090_3156","He drained the last of his cup and tossed some bills on the table."
"easy_money_3158_3178","I'm staying in town."
"easy_money_3179_3205","Let me show you something."
"easy_money_3216_3397","I thought about it and made a quick call, just telling a buddy that I was ""postponing our meeting,"" for a couple of hours, meaning he should come looking for me if I didn't show up."
"easy_money_3398_3496","Charles might not look like much, but I hadn't made it through my life taking that kind of chance."
"easy_money_3497_3625","I put away the cell and used the motion to cover checking the knife in my sleeve and used one leg to check the other in my sock."
"easy_money_3626_3667","I had been an amateur magician for years."
"easy_money_3668_3726","One of my best tricks was pulling a knife out of thin air."
"easy_money_3727_3752","It never failed to amaze."
"easy_money_3754_3759","Sure."
"easy_money_3760_3778","Let's go,"" I said."
"easy_money_3788_3850","We took his rental car back to the motel where he was staying."
"easy_money_3851_4001","The little desk was covered with large books filled with sticky notes, a pile of folders and papers and a laptop computer plugged into the phone line."
"easy_money_4002_4130","There was only one chair, so I sat on the edge of the bed as he handed me a book open to a picture of some sort of stone tablet."
"easy_money_4141_4176","Rapa Nui,"" he said, ""Easter Island."
"easy_money_4177_4267","This codex is one of the few remaining examples of a form of writing known as 'rongorongo."
"easy_money_4269_4401","For a long time no one was able to decipher it, although by deduction, Steven Fischer deciphered some of it in nineteen ninety four."
"easy_money_4402_4559","He mostly read creation stories off objects like the 'Santiago Staff' which said things like, 'All the birds copulated with fish: There issued forth the sun."
"easy_money_4560_4630","But he ignored the inscriptions on skulls and the 'Birdman' statuette."
"easy_money_4631_4675","It was those clues that started all of this."
"easy_money_4677_4718","My small expectations shrank as he spoke."
"easy_money_4719_4764","I didn't see much money in hieroglyphic porn."
"easy_money_4765_5078","He talked on about people with long ears who built the big statues, the ""moai"" and people with short ears who conquered the people with long ears and ate them and how the short eared people didn't really know the secrets of the long ears and had pulled down all the moai statues and destroyed some of the tablets."
"easy_money_5079_5154","And how the missionaries came and the converted natives had destroyed more."
"easy_money_5155_5248","He flipped pages to another image, ""But notice something here in the arrangement of the moai."
"easy_money_5249_5304","See here how they form a pattern, very similar to this?"
"easy_money_5306_5417","He pulled out a small leather diary and opened it to a yellowed page marked with yet another small sticky note."
"easy_money_5418_5513","There was an ink drawing and writing in a tiny neat hand that I couldn't read from where I sat."
"easy_money_5514_5754","I didn't see much resemblance except maybe there were about the same number of points in the cat's cradle thing in the diary and the number of dots on the map showing places where statues stood in a thin line around the coast of the island."
"easy_money_5756_5901","This is the diary of a mysterious explorer named Samuel Curlew who investigated a Mound Builder site in this area in the early eighteen hundreds."
"easy_money_5903_5972","He closed the little book and just about hugged it with satisfaction."
"easy_money_5974_6004","I want to show you that mound."
"easy_money_6005_6119","You know it was these very mounds that originally sparked my interest in history, archeology and then linguistics."
"easy_money_6131_6170","And this mound is where you found gold?"
"easy_money_6172_6218","I was confused enough I let the ""G word"" slip."
"easy_money_6219_6253","Was this some crazy treasure hunt?"
"easy_money_6254_6342","Or maybe this guy was just a wacko who wanted to take me out on a dark road and kill me."
"easy_money_6353_6445","No, it's more complicated than that, but I need to show you the mound for you to understand."
"easy_money_6447_6496","The drawings and the books seemed to wake him up."
"easy_money_6497_6546","He was smiling now and his eyes weren't so tired."
"easy_money_6556_6680","I was having serious cash flow issues back then and had payments to make, so I said, ""yes,"" but my patience was running out."
"easy_money_6690_6713","It was dark as we left."
"easy_money_6714_6752","The drive was shorter than I expected."
"easy_money_6753_6831","We pulled up to a little asphalt parking spot in front of a historical marker."
"easy_money_6832_6932","When he killed the headlights there was no light but moonlight and stars on a light dusting of snow."
"easy_money_6933_6988","A low, black hill blocked the sky right in front of us."
"easy_money_6989_7073","""It's up here,"" he announced stepping over the cable fence and starting up the hill."
"easy_money_7074_7169","We spent the next hour stomping around the hill while he said things like, ""it was right here."""
"easy_money_7179_7331","My patience was long gone, and I was back in the car to warming up when Acres tapped on the window and told me he had found whatever he was looking for."
"easy_money_7332_7431","We trudged back up the hill and he led me to little patch of ground with a stick poking up from it."
"easy_money_7432_7470","It looked like a bamboo walking stick."
"easy_money_7471_7555","""This is it,"" he leaned down and motioned for me to look at something on the ground."
"easy_money_7472_7482","This is it"
"easy_money_7556_7606","I casually slid a knife into my palm just in case."
"easy_money_7608_7684","See how the lines form the pattern in the journal, the same one as the moai."
"easy_money_7695_7749","""So you drew this?"" I asked vaguely, slow to catch on."
"easy_money_7696_7713","So you drew this?"
"easy_money_7759_7815","He looked hurt and rapped on the ground with his finger."
"easy_money_7817_7828","It's stone."
"easy_money_7829_7837","Ancient."
"easy_money_7839_7875","He stood up using the stick to help."
"easy_money_7876_7972","For the first time he looked cold and stiff in his tourist gear, making me glad I was in a suit."
"easy_money_7974_8005","Here stand beside me,"" he said."
"easy_money_8007_8079","I'm not sure if I can take you with me so I need to show you the device."
"easy_money_8091_8098","Device?"
"easy_money_8100_8193","I expected him to pull out a gadget with blinking lights and was wondering which way to duck."
"easy_money_8204_8219","Trick, gesture."
"easy_money_8220_8246","It's like sleight of hand."
"easy_money_8248_8294","He wriggled his fingers and then blew on them."
"easy_money_8296_8324","OK, watch and remember this."
"easy_money_8325_8398","I'm going to do it in two parts, last part first so it won't take effect."
"easy_money_8399_8457","Remember to reverse the two parts when you actually do it."
"easy_money_8459_8601","Stunned I watched as he made several ridiculous passes with his hands paused and nodded then did a sort of sign language stutter of some sort."
"easy_money_8603_8682","I learned this from a skull shard rongorongo, they aren't all writing language."
"easy_money_8683_8713","Some are just a memory device."
"easy_money_8724_8775","""Mnemonic."" I muttered, which seemed to please him."
"easy_money_8725_8734","Mnemonic."
"easy_money_8786_8790","Yes."
"easy_money_8791_8857","They help in remembering steps in a ritual or ceremonial gestures."
"easy_money_8858_8922","There's a long history of Polynesian gesture and dance language."
"easy_money_8923_8937","Now you do it."
"easy_money_8939_8992","He smiled and I could see his teeth in the moonlight."
"easy_money_9002_9152","I wanted to slug him, but he had the keys to the car back and I figured I'd humor him while I figured out how to get them without violating my parole."
"easy_money_9153_9249","I didn't have much trouble duplicating his hand waving even though I hadn't paid much attention."
"easy_money_9250_9295","I even swapped the two parts as he had asked."
"easy_money_9296_9414","I thought he was surprised at my dexterity when his jaw dropped, but he shouted, ""No!"" just before everything changed."
"easy_money_9424_9480","I was standing on a perfectly flat square of dark stone."
"easy_money_9481_9606","For as far as I could see by a weak, gray light the stone stepped up and down making little hills and terraces and platforms."
"easy_money_9607_9682","I seemed to be somewhere in the middle -- there was as much above as below."
"easy_money_9683_9729","The sky was dull and featureless and overcast."
"easy_money_9730_9882","The air smelled bad in some way I can't describe, and at my feet I could see the same design from the little journal and the mound carved into the rock."
"easy_money_9883_9898","I was in shock."
"easy_money_9899_10013","The blood pounded in my head, and I just stood there blinking and listening to a sort of ringing whine in my ears."
"easy_money_10023_10056","The next moment, Acres was there."
"easy_money_10057_10099","Hands up in the same way mine were frozen."
"easy_money_10100_10129","We just looked at each other."
"easy_money_10130_10260","I guess, thinking back, I might have expected him to gloat, but the view was the kind of thing that humbles you, shuts your mouth."
"easy_money_10261_10339","We just stood looking at each other for a little while, I don't know how long."
"easy_money_10349_10392","""What is it?"" was all I could think to say."
"easy_money_10350_10361","What is it?"
"easy_money_10402_10422","Acres just shrugged."
"easy_money_10424_10432","A place."
"easy_money_10433_10446","I don't know."
"easy_money_10447_10528","I think this whole thing,"" he waved his hand at the horizon, ""is one big machine."
"easy_money_10529_10588","And the markers were carved later, not be whoever built it."
"easy_money_10589_10651","The markers are places where it's safe to come here and leave."
"easy_money_10663_10668","Safe?"
"easy_money_10670_10686","I looked around."
"easy_money_10687_10729","One thing this place didn't seem was safe."
"easy_money_10740_10765","Let me show you the rest."
"easy_money_10767_10821","He started walking down the steps and around a corner."
"easy_money_10822_10966","It would have taken plenty to surprise me after what I had already seen, but My jaw was banging against my shoelaces when I rounded that corner."
"easy_money_10976_11123","I'm not sure how something so big could have been hidden by that little turn in landscape, but maybe perspective doesn't work quite the same there."
"easy_money_11124_11293","Glaring down at me from no more than twenty feet away was a grimacing, thirty foot tall black face with staring, blue and white eyes and it wore a ridiculous little hat."
"easy_money_11294_11394","For some reason I thought of a giant clown face from a carnival ride, but it scared the hell out me."
"easy_money_11395_11503","Acres stood beside it and somehow using him as a yardstick for the scale of the thing made it easier to see."
"easy_money_11504_11518","It was a moai."
"easy_money_11519_11596","He had a serious, sincere look on his face and he was pointing to the ground."
"easy_money_11598_11632","This is what I wanted to show you."
"easy_money_11643_11753","I looked down and saw he was pointing to another marker just slightly different from the one we had just left."
"easy_money_11754_11881","I was pretty rattled, but things fell together for me looking at the big statue, the Hawaiian shirt and the mark on the ground."
"easy_money_11883_11897","Easter Island?"
"easy_money_11908_11921","Acres nodded."
"easy_money_11931_11998","It was all too much for me so I focused on the part I could handle."
"easy_money_12000_12039","So what does this have to do with gold?"
"easy_money_12051_12182","You could step on that marker and make the gestures, the 'device,' and it would be like pushing a button in a very complex machine."
"easy_money_12183_12228","You would end up on a small hill on Rapa Nui."
"easy_money_12229_12347","You could step three feet to the right and do the same thing, and you would end up buried alive in a nearby rock face."
"easy_money_12348_12391","But I know how to make it take me anywhere."
"easy_money_12393_12463","He pulled a sheet of folded paper from his pocket and handed it to me."
"easy_money_12464_12575","It read, ""Department of the Treasury, Financial Management Service, Status Report of U.S. Treasury-Owned Gold."""
"easy_money_12576_12637","He pointed to a row that read, ""Deep Storage: Fort Knox, KY."""
"easy_money_12647_12678","I sucked in a whole lot of air."
"easy_money_12680_12689","Anywhere?"
"easy_money_12701_12792","Anywhere,"" he walked around the moai and came back wrestling with a big, heavy bar of gold."
"easy_money_12794_12835","They only check deep storage once a year."
"easy_money_12836_12866","Otherwise the vault is sealed."
"easy_money_12878_12911","Does anyone else know about this?"
"easy_money_12912_12929","How much is that?"
"easy_money_12941_13009","No, they would have been on Rapa Nui if they knew, ready to stop me."
"easy_money_13010_13069","This is the 400 ounces which I mentioned at the restaurant."
"easy_money_13070_13116","About $150,000 dollars at this morning's rate."
"easy_money_13127_13160","I looked at the sheet in my hand."
"easy_money_13162_13190","Deep Storage: Fort Knox, Ky."
"easy_money_13192_13266","it read, ""147,341,858.382 Fine Troy Ounces, Book Value: $6,221,097,412.78"""
"easy_money_13267_13290","I had to read it twice."
"easy_money_13291_13358","I had never seen a dollar sign in front of that many number before."
"easy_money_13360_13422","I thought they didn't keep gold there anymore, just nerve gas."
"easy_money_13434_13458","The gold is still there."
"easy_money_13459_13514","How much can we sell before someone becomes suspicious?"
"easy_money_13516_13613","Charles put the bar down and slid a web pouch over it with shoulder straps like a small backpack."
"easy_money_13623_13705","""None,"" I said and slipped the knife into his neck right at the base of his skull."
"easy_money_13624_13628","None"
"easy_money_13706_13762","Call me small minded, but you know ""a bird in the hand."""
"easy_money_13763_13838","All that gold in Fort Knox was just too much for me to wrap my head around."
"easy_money_13839_13920","But I could handle a hundred and fifty-K easy, say seventy-five-K from the fence."
"easy_money_13921_13995","I slipped the little pouch over my back and wiped the knife on his jacket."
"easy_money_13996_14058","Then I made my way back to the little marker where we came in."
"easy_money_14059_14141","His mistake had been in telling me the same gesture opened the door the other way."
"easy_money_14142_14201","I worried for just a moment when I started waving my hands."
"easy_money_14203_14226","What if it didn't work?"
"easy_money_14228_14310","So the icy wind at the top of the mound and the bright moon came as a real relief."
"easy_money_14320_14433","The gold was heavy on my back, and I was all the way to the car before I realized I had left the keys on Charles."
"easy_money_14443_14493","The highway patrol was just bound to come by then."
"easy_money_14494_14549","After that it was just connect the dots back to prison."
"easy_money_14550_14673","The rental car records pointed to Acres, and there was enough blood on the knife to match DNA from Acres comb in the motel."
"easy_money_14674_14785","They never bothered trying to explain how Acres made it into the country without a ticket on a plane or a boat."
"easy_money_14786_14877","But they speculated all through the trial about where the gold came from, offered me deals."
"easy_money_14878_14943","The prosecution liked the idea that Acres was my smuggler's mule."
"easy_money_14944_14984","I was a one man gold cartel in the news."
"easy_money_14994_15070","I'm just wondering what they'll think when they open that vault in Kentucky."
"easy_money_15071_15112","And I still wonder why Charles picked me?"
"easy_money_15113_15166","Maybe he didn't know anybody else with ""connections."""
"easy_money_15167_15281","But mostly, I'm wondering what will happen when I try to make those gestures, that ""device"" right here in my cell?"
"easy_money_15282_15381","Acres said it was dangerous, but maybe I could find my way back to the mound or Easter Island even."
"easy_money_15382_15465","I figure it can't be worse than the lethal injection that's waiting for me at dawn."
"easy_money_15466_15528","I don't really believe I'll make it or I wouldn't say a thing."
"easy_money_15529_15630","But if I do make it, it won't matter what I tell you, because there won't be a jail that can hold me."
"easy_money_15631_15710","I'm leaving this just to tell ""whom it may concern"" to kiss my ever-lovin' ass."
"easy_money_15711_15724","Wish me luck."
"easy_money_15725_15739","I out of here."
"hotel-california_3_20",">Hotel California"
"hotel-california_22_49","Fact: Sound is a vibration."
"hotel-california_50_136","Sound travels as a mechanical wave through a medium, and in space, there is no medium."
"hotel-california_137_227","So when my shuttle malfunctioned and the airlocks didn't keep the air in, I heard nothing."
"hotel-california_228_317","After the first whoosh of the air being sucked away, there was lightning, but no thunder."
"hotel-california_318_356","Eyes bulging in panic, but no screams."
"hotel-california_357_383","Quiet and peaceful, right?"
"hotel-california_384_550","Such a relief to never again hear my crewmate Jesse natter about his girl back on Earth and that all-expenses-paid vacation-for-two she won last time he was on leave."
"hotel-california_551_740","I swore, if I ever had to see a photo of him in a skimpy bathing suit again, giving the camera a cheesy thumbs-up from a lounge chair on one of those white sandy beaches, I'd kiss a monkey."
"hotel-california_741_767","Metaphorically, of course."
"hotel-california_769_948","Fact: If, before all the air is sucked out of the ship, a person is so lucky to have stuffed him or herself into a space suit, that person has less than twenty-four hours to live."
"hotel-california_949_1005","This is more than the person would have sans space suit."
"hotel-california_1006_1233","Me, I found a space suit, but it was statistically unlikely that I, and whomever else has followed suit (pun intended), would manage to repair our ship before the less-than-twenty-four hours are up; yes, studies have been done."
"hotel-california_1234_1256","So, twenty-four hours."
"hotel-california_1257_1270","Give or take."
"hotel-california_1272_1419","About the time I was composing my last words in my head, trying not to think too much about what suffocating felt like, that's when I heard a bell."
"hotel-california_1421_1457","My first thought: I was going crazy."
"hotel-california_1458_1538","Twenty-four hours of silence (vacuum, remember); was I hallucinating noises now?"
"hotel-california_1540_1557","I heard it again."
"hotel-california_1558_1670","It was a fine bell, reminiscent of ancient stone churches and the towering cathedrals I'd seen in documentaries."
"hotel-california_1671_1712","And accompanying the bell, I saw a light."
"hotel-california_1714_1792","Now, there were two things here that made ridiculously small amounts of sense."
"hotel-california_1793_1847","First, the whole in-a-vacuum why's-there-a-bell thing."
"hotel-california_1848_2039","Second, I was floating in the dark remnants of my broken ship, and any conceivable light sources were not within view; starlight is a distinctly different color and significantly less bright."
"hotel-california_2041_2086","These signals were the heralds of my saviors."
"hotel-california_2088_2134","The first words they said to me meant nothing."
"hotel-california_2135_2221","I wasn't listening; I didn't care; I was going to live; I was going to keep breathing."
"hotel-california_2222_2259","Next to those, nothing else mattered."
"hotel-california_2260_2435","The recycled air tasted sweet in my mouth, and all thoughts that crossed my mind were cheap metaphors about life-giving substances and how breathing was like sex, only better."
"hotel-california_2436_2488","(I reserved the right to revise this opinion later.)"
"hotel-california_2490_2569","When I was done mentally exclaiming over my impossible rescue, I looked around."
"hotel-california_2570_2791","The ship, it was odd and old, either so outdated or so heavily modified that I couldn't tell what make it was, and somehow, the crew standing around me fit the same description, a singularly atypical amalgamation of folk."
"hotel-california_2792_2845","And me, I guess I was one more piece in their puzzle."
"hotel-california_2846_2931","I was one more scrap to weld onto the rest, one more stranded survivor who was found."
"hotel-california_2933_2955","I was now one of them."
"hotel-california_2957_2984","This story, it's our story."
"hotel-california_2985_3092","The survivors of the unfortunate accidents, the catastrophic malfunctions, the fateful crashes: this is us."
"hotel-california_3093_3168","Floating alone, each of us facing the silence of the vacuum, we were found."
"hotel-california_3170_3203","Once found, we can never be lost."
"hotel-california_3205_3234","This is our Hotel California."
"hotel-california_3236_3255","We can never leave."
"hotel-california_3257_3300","“So, I'm on a ship now? You do this a lot?”"
"hotel-california_3257_3280","“So, I'm on a ship now?"
"hotel-california_3281_3300","You do this a lot?”"
"hotel-california_3302_3374","A woman, introduced as Tiffany and neither tall nor beautiful, shrugged."
"hotel-california_3375_3390","“Now and then.”"
"hotel-california_3392_3444","“What about my crewmates? Why didn't you save them?”"
"hotel-california_3392_3417","“What about my crewmates?"
"hotel-california_3418_3444","Why didn't you save them?”"
"hotel-california_3445_3575","As much as Jesse had irritated me, I didn't like the picture my brain drew of him floating in his grave, body swollen and bloated."
"hotel-california_3576_3616","Who would tell his girl how he had died?"
"hotel-california_3618_3647","“Couldn't,” said the captain."
"hotel-california_3618_3629","“Couldn't,”"
"hotel-california_3648_3740","Jefferson, he called himself, clean-shaven and smart, a picture of the perfect entrepreneur."
"hotel-california_3741_3794","An opportunist and a businessman, that was Jefferson."
"hotel-california_3795_3848","“We're selective about our passengers,” he continued."
"hotel-california_3795_3834","“We're selective about our passengers,”"
"hotel-california_3849_3881","“You fit the bill. They didn't.”"
"hotel-california_3849_3867","“You fit the bill."
"hotel-california_3868_3881","They didn't.”"
"hotel-california_3883_3980","Tiffany, she looked at the captain, grinned and flipped her greasy brown locks over her shoulder."
"hotel-california_3981_3998","She turned to me."
"hotel-california_3999_4081","“Come on,” she said, before I could say anything else, “let's get you settled in.”"
"hotel-california_3999_4009","“Come on,”"
"hotel-california_4054_4081","“let's get you settled in.”"
"hotel-california_4082_4104","No time for questions."
"hotel-california_4105_4125","No time for answers."
"hotel-california_4128_4435","The ship had all the usual accoutrements (artificial gravity, tastefully painted walls, sound dampeners to keep the noise of the engines from driving the crew batshit insane, recycled air systems), and a few less-usual: lush carpeting, lighting that was decorative as well as functional, spacious corridors."
"hotel-california_4436_4557","The occasional painting hung on the wall (generic landscapes and portraits of old people no one has ever met, primarily)."
"hotel-california_4558_4651","Glimpses of elegant rooms down the branching hallways; music; voices; the aroma of real food."
"hotel-california_4653_4669","This was heaven."
"hotel-california_4670_4710","No seventy-two virgins, but it would do."
"hotel-california_4712_4733","“Where are we going?”"
"hotel-california_4734_4742","I asked."
"hotel-california_4744_4764","Tiffany looked back."
"hotel-california_4765_4832","“To your quarters. It's not far; you're not going to get blisters.”"
"hotel-california_4765_4783","“To your quarters."
"hotel-california_4784_4832","It's not far; you're not going to get blisters.”"
"hotel-california_4834_4896","“No, I meant, where's the ship going? What's our destination?”"
"hotel-california_4834_4871","“No, I meant, where's the ship going?"
"hotel-california_4872_4896","What's our destination?”"
"hotel-california_4898_4927","Tiffany, she stopped walking."
"hotel-california_4928_5022","She gave me a look, pitying and a little pleased that she got to be the one to share the news."
"hotel-california_5023_5072","“Honey,” she said, “You're going to be delighted."
"hotel-california_5023_5031","“Honey,”"
"hotel-california_5042_5118","“You're going to be delighted. Destination everywhere. Destination nowhere.”"
"hotel-california_5073_5096","Destination everywhere."
"hotel-california_5097_5118","Destination nowhere.”"
"hotel-california_5120_5134","This was hell."
"hotel-california_5135_5232","I died in those last moments, suffocating on my own exhaled breath, and this, this was my reward."
"hotel-california_5234_5438","Fact: The speed of sound in dry air at twenty degrees Celsius or sixty-eight degrees Fahrenheit is three hundred and forty-three meters per second, or one thousand one hundred twenty-five feet per second."
"hotel-california_5440_5504","It took me a couple days to realize I was, in fact, still alive."
"hotel-california_5505_5614","I mean, sure, I'd had my moment of elation when I had first realized I'd been rescued, but it didn't sink in."
"hotel-california_5615_6049","After watching my ship tear apart, after spending a good twenty-three hours floating in silence in the wreck, wondering whether I was currently facing stars belonging to the constellation Libra or the constellation Orion when those stars were viewed from Earth, wondering what it felt like to suffocate, and after the feeling that yes, I was in fact going to die alone in space had sunk in, it took time for that feeling to dissipate."
"hotel-california_6051_6071","Fact: I wasn't dead."
"hotel-california_6073_6115","After I realized this, I left my quarters."
"hotel-california_6116_6259","The lightscreen provided had informed me when and where official meals were taking place, but I hadn't bothered to acknowledge the invitations."
"hotel-california_6260_6390","It hadn't seemed relevant, somehow, given that I was still reeling over the explosion, the deaths of my crewmates, and the rescue."
"hotel-california_6391_6493","I've heard there are a number of stages of grief and shock; I guess I was working my way through them."
"hotel-california_6494_6528","Food was delivered to my quarters."
"hotel-california_6529_6597","Initially, I couldn't figure out why—I hadn't requested any be sent."
"hotel-california_6598_6696","Then I realized, someone must have noticed I hadn't left, and was nice enough to send food my way."
"hotel-california_6697_6746","The accompanying bottle of wine was a nice touch."
"hotel-california_6747_6837","I must have consumed it, too, because later on, the plates and the bottle were both empty."
"hotel-california_6838_7023","I spent a lot of time lying on my back on the bed, staring up at the little etched swirls in the ceiling, or slumped in the old-fashioned armchair, staring out the windows at the stars."
"hotel-california_7024_7062","I did a lot of staring and not moving."
"hotel-california_7064_7108","Man, was it good to be done with that stage."
"hotel-california_7111_7157","It was time to find out what hell looked like."
"hotel-california_7159_7186","Fact: Hell is other people."
"hotel-california_7187_7215","Sure, the ship was spacious."
"hotel-california_7216_7323","We didn't pick up many passengers—just the select, special few, scattered here and there between the stars."
"hotel-california_7324_7381","But we were all on this ship, and we were on it together."
"hotel-california_7383_7432","Cliques form in any decent-sized group of people."
"hotel-california_7433_7595","Me, I was singled out by Sarah, an unassuming forty-something lady with a glass of champagne in one hand and the arm of a scrawny but tall blond man in the other."
"hotel-california_7596_7720","She sidled up to me as I was scooping little round crackers and what appeared to be a baked cilantro cream dip onto a plate."
"hotel-california_7721_7950","The plate, by the way, was already loaded with folded pieces of smoked pink fish, paprika-dusted deviled eggs, toothpicks stabbed through green vegetables and slices of cheese, and balls of meat smothered in a tomato-based sauce."
"hotel-california_7951_8058","Luxurious, even compared to the fare one would find in the high-class space stations and pleasure cruisers."
"hotel-california_8059_8178","Compared to what a mere engineer would get on your typical cargo ship, it was mouthwateringly, lip-smackingly gorgeous."
"hotel-california_8179_8272","I wondered if the food delivered to my quarters the past few days had been similarly amazing."
"hotel-california_8273_8305","I decided it couldn't have been."
"hotel-california_8307_8406","“Liking the taste of the sweet life, eh? I'm Sarah, and this is Alexis—you must be the new pickup.”"
"hotel-california_8307_8347","“Liking the taste of the sweet life, eh?"
"hotel-california_8348_8406","I'm Sarah, and this is Alexis—you must be the new pickup.”"
"hotel-california_8407_8438","She looked me over approvingly."
"hotel-california_8439_8485","“Come on, let's get you a glass of champagne.”"
"hotel-california_8486_8596","I looked longingly at the slices of cheddar olive bread as she whisked me over to the bar, but didn't protest."
"hotel-california_8598_8648","The bar was manned by an expensive humanoid robot."
"hotel-california_8649_8785","It turned toward Sarah's wave and acknowledged her with a nod, moments later setting a fluted glass of sparkling liquid in front of her."
"hotel-california_8786_8840","I marveled at the robot's smoothness and coordination."
"hotel-california_8841_8874","Clearly, it was a high-end model."
"hotel-california_8875_9005","Sarah transferred the glass to my free hand and pulled me away from the bar for more introductions, with Alexis trailing after us."
"hotel-california_9007_9045","I spent the evening listening, mostly."
"hotel-california_9046_9117","Listening and stuffing my face with all the bits of fine food provided."
"hotel-california_9118_9219","No one minded; Sarah's inner circle was content to fill our circle of couches with plenty of chatter."
"hotel-california_9220_9271","Ray, a plump man who was grey where he wasn't bald."
"hotel-california_9272_9329","Zheng, short and dark and lean, with a very intense gaze."
"hotel-california_9330_9364","He made me a little uncomfortable."
"hotel-california_9365_9457","Kishori, petite, her hair strung out in a series of braids that reached nearly to her waist."
"hotel-california_9458_9566","I categorized them based on their appearances, hoping I'd be able to pick them out of the crowd again later."
"hotel-california_9567_9980","Most of their chatter was meaningless to me—stories of day-to-day activities, how so-and-so had been seen in so-and-so's table at lunch and my wasn't that a surprise, and why hadn't the chef concocted this delectable a selection of appetizers for the dance the other night, but of course those rolled meat pastries reminded one of the pastries back on Earth, didn't they, and this was somehow an interesting fact."
"hotel-california_9982_10082","After the first half-hour, I stopped expending effort to keep names and stories and gossip straight."
"hotel-california_10083_10117","I wasn't learning anything useful."
"hotel-california_10118_10195","I could have started asking questions, but I wanted to get my bearings first."
"hotel-california_10196_10224","Tonight was for observation."
"hotel-california_10225_10325","I didn't bother trying to seek out a different group of potentially more interesting people, though."
"hotel-california_10326_10470","They all looked the same: clusters of social butterflies surrounded by the less apt, the hangers-on, the circle with whom the gossip was shared."
"hotel-california_10471_10502","I wondered at the ship instead."
"hotel-california_10503_10595","All the fine food and the ornamental lighting, it had to be exorbitantly pricey to maintain."
"hotel-california_10596_10709","If the barkeep was any indication, I suspected similarly high-class robots fulfilled other positions on the ship."
"hotel-california_10710_10832","How they were all powered was a mystery—as good as the technology got, a quality robot like that was still an energy sink."
"hotel-california_10833_10981","It was the brain, mostly; the amount of information the machine had to process to be able to function at the level it did ate up a lot of resources."
"hotel-california_10983_11120","Sarah's crowd took turns taking my champagne flute to the bar to be refilled, all seemingly pleased to have a new set of ears to talk at."
"hotel-california_11121_11369","I slowly returned my attention to the conversation and was pleasantly surprised to find that it had turned to a heated analysis of a recent abstract film—done in the style of old flatscreen movies—that I had seen during off-time at Geminia Station."
"hotel-california_11371_11507","By the end of the evening, when I finally followed the slow trickle of people out of the room, a satisfying haze had settled on my mind."
"hotel-california_11508_11531","It was nice, I decided."
"hotel-california_11532_11542","This ship."
"hotel-california_11543_11553","This life."
"hotel-california_11554_11697","The nagging questions about where the ship had come from and what its purpose in rescuing me was still nagged, but somehow, seemed less urgent."
"hotel-california_11698_11799","Did it truly matter what the ship's origin was and why Jefferson had saved me, if now, I was content?"
"hotel-california_11801_11839","Fact: It's easy to fall into patterns."
"hotel-california_11840_11946","I would wake late, checking the clock on my room's lightscreen to make sure I hadn't slept through brunch."
"hotel-california_11947_12036","I would join the rest of the ship for meals, and I would take my turn in the weight room."
"hotel-california_12037_12144","I would watch old films on the entertainment screens, taking mental notes for later dinnertime discussions."
"hotel-california_12145_12198","I would immerse myself in new virtual reality flicks."
"hotel-california_12199_12410","I would attend afternoon dance classes, so that when the evening dances came around (modeled after the historical social gatherings of several hundred years prior), I would be less of an embarrassment to myself."
"hotel-california_12412_12436","I did not ask questions."
"hotel-california_12437_12460","I told myself I should."
"hotel-california_12461_12568","I told myself that tonight, the observation period would end and I'd start puzzling out the ship's mystery."
"hotel-california_12569_12602","But I fell under the ship's sway."
"hotel-california_12603_12877","Bereft of my previous familiar life, I latched onto Kishori and Ray and Zheng, and Sarah with Alexis dragged along on her arm now and then (he was mostly her favorite dancing partner; she confided to us one night that his conversational skills left something to be desired)."
"hotel-california_12878_13042","I smothered thoughts of friends back on Earth—this was my long-awaited vacation, my clean break and my temporary retreat; I'd try contacting those friends tomorrow."
"hotel-california_13043_13291","I continued to care little for shipwide gossip, but our discussions of films and flicks, old and new, brought out my artistic, story-loving, argumentative side, a side of me I'd tucked into a back storage compartment during my years as an engineer."
"hotel-california_13292_13323","It was a good life, if surreal."
"hotel-california_13324_13374","But I wasn't sure I wanted the dream stage to end."
"hotel-california_13376_13407","Fact: Some places are timeless."
"hotel-california_13408_13506","Days passed, weeks passed, but I couldn't tell if it had been months or years since I was rescued."
"hotel-california_13507_13551","All there was, all I remembered, was a blur."
"hotel-california_13552_13749","Gathering for drinks in the parlors, playing dress up with all the fine clothes I found in the closets (some of it modern, some of it period dress for special themed events), idling in the lounges."
"hotel-california_13750_13796","Now and then, a new face mingled in the crowd."
"hotel-california_13797_13917","Other faces washed out, fading into the backdrop of carpets and fake glass chandeliers and the muted hum of the engines."
"hotel-california_13919_14103","One of these evenings, we were gathered in the South Ballroom for post-dinner drinks, lounging on couches and watching other members of our populace move in circles on the dance floor."
"hotel-california_14104_14176","(The 'South' was in the title to suggest that there were more ballrooms."
"hotel-california_14109_14116","'South'"
"hotel-california_14177_14192","There weren't.)"
"hotel-california_14193_14425","Sarah's circle had picked up another newcomer, Adrienne, a short blond girl who we all agreed was barely old enough to attend a traditional university back on Earth, let alone work on the ship in whose wreck Jefferson had found her."
"hotel-california_14426_14601","Maybe it was her curiosity, asking a question I should have asked long before, that turned the conversation serious; maybe there was just something special about that evening."
"hotel-california_14602_14701","Maybe we had all tired of the frivolity of our life, hitting some threshold or some breaking point."
"hotel-california_14702_14799","Regardless, when Adrienne asked what the ship's purpose was, we all gave it a measure of thought."
"hotel-california_14800_14931","We dredged up half-fledged theories and inchoate explanations, tossing these out the same way we pitched ideas about the art films."
"hotel-california_14933_14993","“I believe we'll see the end of the universe,” said Tiffany."
"hotel-california_14933_14979","“I believe we'll see the end of the universe,”"
"hotel-california_14994_15126","Captain's cohort, she had a glass of orange-brown liquid in one hand; it might have been orange juice and some kind of berry liquor."
"hotel-california_15127_15156","She swirled it speculatively."
"hotel-california_15157_15176","I watched Adrienne."
"hotel-california_15177_15222","She tilted her head, listening, not speaking."
"hotel-california_15224_15283","“Impossible,” said Zheng, sitting in the chair to her left."
"hotel-california_15224_15237","“Impossible,”"
"hotel-california_15284_15310","“We can't live that long.”"
"hotel-california_15312_15380","“Maybe the universe will end sooner than you think,” said Jefferson."
"hotel-california_15312_15364","“Maybe the universe will end sooner than you think,”"
"hotel-california_15381_15430","Yeah, the captain was there, with the rest of us."
"hotel-california_15431_15509","He didn't drink, but he made a point of mingling with all the various cliques."
"hotel-california_15511_15650","“Maybe we'll travel at the speed of light and we won't age,” said Sarah, setting her wine glass on the little round end table by her couch."
"hotel-california_15511_15571","“Maybe we'll travel at the speed of light and we won't age,”"
"hotel-california_15651_15705","“Maybe we're already traveling at the speed of light.”"
"hotel-california_15708_15736","Tiffany, she nodded eagerly."
"hotel-california_15737_15762","“Relatively says it all.”"
"hotel-california_15764_15778","Zheng scoffed."
"hotel-california_15779_16051","“Also impossible. Even if we were traveling at ninety-nine percent of the speed of light—that's assuming you ignore science and pretend that such a thing is possible, because it isn't—we'd still age. We'd just appear to age slower than people not traveling as fast as us.”"
"hotel-california_15779_15796","“Also impossible."
"hotel-california_15797_15978","Even if we were traveling at ninety-nine percent of the speed of light—that's assuming you ignore science and pretend that such a thing is possible, because it isn't—we'd still age."
"hotel-california_15979_16051","We'd just appear to age slower than people not traveling as fast as us.”"
"hotel-california_16053_16059","“And?”"
"hotel-california_16060_16071","said Sarah."
"hotel-california_16072_16200","“Aging is relative, anyway. Besides, I wouldn't mind being around forever. Give our ancestors purpose. Keep their dreams alive.”"
"hotel-california_16072_16099","“Aging is relative, anyway."
"hotel-california_16100_16146","Besides, I wouldn't mind being around forever."
"hotel-california_16147_16174","Give our ancestors purpose."
"hotel-california_16175_16200","Keep their dreams alive.”"
"hotel-california_16202_16270","“New hypothesis,” suggested Kishori, slipping into the conversation."
"hotel-california_16202_16219","“New hypothesis,”"
"hotel-california_16271_16338","“No one's immortal. In fact, the opposite: We're all going to die.”"
"hotel-california_16271_16290","“No one's immortal."
"hotel-california_16291_16338","In fact, the opposite: We're all going to die.”"
"hotel-california_16340_16365","“Bleak,” commented Zheng."
"hotel-california_16340_16348","“Bleak,”"
"hotel-california_16366_16382","“But I like it.”"
"hotel-california_16383_16416","He grinned at Sarah, who frowned."
"hotel-california_16417_16482","Ray took a drink from his glass of ice water, and shook his head."
"hotel-california_16484_16565","“We're all going to die, so what better thing to do than enjoy the time we have?”"
"hotel-california_16566_16622","Kishori gestured to the bar, the carpets, the paintings."
"hotel-california_16623_16656","“All the luxuries money can buy.”"
"hotel-california_16658_16689","Tiffany took a drink, thinking."
"hotel-california_16690_16735","“All the luxuries money can buy,” she echoed."
"hotel-california_16690_16723","“All the luxuries money can buy,”"
"hotel-california_16737_16760","Zheng looked skeptical."
"hotel-california_16761_16776","“Paid for how?”"
"hotel-california_16778_16809","“Smuggling,” responded Kishori."
"hotel-california_16778_16790","“Smuggling,”"
"hotel-california_16810_16825","Matter-of-fact."
"hotel-california_16826_16852","Jefferson snorted, amused."
"hotel-california_16853_16942","“Think about it,” Kishori continued, “where else would we get the money to buy all this?”"
"hotel-california_16853_16870","“Think about it,”"
"hotel-california_16890_16942","“where else would we get the money to buy all this?”"
"hotel-california_16944_16999","“Renegade smugglers. So what's our cargo, eh, captain?”"
"hotel-california_16944_16964","“Renegade smugglers."
"hotel-california_16965_16999","So what's our cargo, eh, captain?”"
"hotel-california_17000_17062","Zheng joked, leaning back in his chair with his glass of wine."
"hotel-california_17064_17102","Jefferson shook his head and stood up."
"hotel-california_17103_17149","“I'll leave you to your speculation,” he said."
"hotel-california_17103_17140","“I'll leave you to your speculation,”"
"hotel-california_17150_17200","A chorus of good nights followed him out the door."
"hotel-california_17202_17242","After the captain left, Zheng leaned in."
"hotel-california_17243_17312","He set his glass down on an end table, steepled his fingers together."
"hotel-california_17313_17343","“We're revolting,” he told us."
"hotel-california_17313_17331","“We're revolting,”"
"hotel-california_17344_17553","“And I don't mean that you disgust me. No, we're the start of a rebellion. Did you hear what the captain said earlier? He means, we're going to change the future. The universe as we know it won't be the same.”"
"hotel-california_17344_17382","“And I don't mean that you disgust me."
"hotel-california_17383_17418","No, we're the start of a rebellion."
"hotel-california_17419_17462","Did you hear what the captain said earlier?"
"hotel-california_17463_17506","He means, we're going to change the future."
"hotel-california_17507_17553","The universe as we know it won't be the same.”"
"hotel-california_17555_17581","“That's dumb,” said Sarah."
"hotel-california_17555_17569","“That's dumb,”"
"hotel-california_17582_17634","“Wouldn't we know it if we were part of a rebellion?"
"hotel-california_17636_17657","Zheng shook his head."
"hotel-california_17658_17784","“The captain selected us for a reason. He has inside intelligence—how else would he know where to find us? He knows about us.”"
"hotel-california_17658_17696","“The captain selected us for a reason."
"hotel-california_17697_17764","He has inside intelligence—how else would he know where to find us?"
"hotel-california_17765_17784","He knows about us.”"
"hotel-california_17786_17818","“That's still dumb,” said Sarah."
"hotel-california_17786_17806","“That's still dumb,”"
"hotel-california_17819_17942","“Inside intelligence? Don't you remember, there's not exactly one big galactic government from which to steal information.”"
"hotel-california_17819_17840","“Inside intelligence?"
"hotel-california_17841_17942","Don't you remember, there's not exactly one big galactic government from which to steal information.”"
"hotel-california_17944_17981","“I still like my idea,” said Tiffany."
"hotel-california_17944_17967","“I still like my idea,”"
"hotel-california_17983_18152","Me, I followed Adrienne's example and didn't speak up (fabricating excuses to myself to stay safely in gather-info observation mode), though I thought Zheng had a point."
"hotel-california_18153_18196","Jefferson didn't share how he found people."
"hotel-california_18197_18299","He didn't share how he knew exactly where the wrecks were, or why he saved some people but not others."
"hotel-california_18300_18329","But then again, no one asked."
"hotel-california_18330_18380","I guess we all figured, he knew what he was doing."
"hotel-california_18381_18439","He had been at this savior business longer than any of us."
"hotel-california_18440_18484","I wondered if Adrienne would ask about that."
"hotel-california_18486_18536","“We're going to mean something,” Zheng was saying."
"hotel-california_18486_18518","“We're going to mean something,”"
"hotel-california_18537_18654","“What we do, rebelling against the oppression of the many governments that oppose us, we're going to leave a legacy.”"
"hotel-california_18655_18674","He sounded certain."
"hotel-california_18675_18694","Enthusiastic, even."
"hotel-california_18696_18770","Ray, he shook his head, and broke the quiet he'd held most of the evening."
"hotel-california_18771_18797","“You've got it all wrong.”"
"hotel-california_18798_18873","He looked from Sarah, to Adrienne, to Zheng, to Kishori and Tiffany, to me."
"hotel-california_18874_19163","“Obviously, we can't last longer than the rest of the universe. We aren't giving anyone purpose. We're not even going to leave a legacy. All we're doing is existing. All we're doing is eating and drinking and shitting, breathing and fucking and nothing important, ever. We aren't special.”"
"hotel-california_18874_18937","“Obviously, we can't last longer than the rest of the universe."

"hotel-california_19144_19163","We aren't special.”"
"hotel-california_19165_19197","“Again, bleak,” commented Zheng."
"hotel-california_19165_19180","“Again, bleak,”"
"hotel-california_19198_19236","Adrienne gestured for him to be quiet."
"hotel-california_19237_19310","She leaned forward, setting her elbows on the foot stool in front of her."
"hotel-california_19312_19405","“You never know when it will end,” Ray continued, not addressing any one of us in particular."
"hotel-california_19312_19346","“You never know when it will end,”"
"hotel-california_19406_19862","“You can't hold on forever, even if you don't ever, ever want to forget. How long until the memories slip away? How long until all you remember is this, the ship, the thick red carpeting, the chandeliers, the empty conversations you hold with the other shells who used to be people? When your life, the reason you lived, the people and faces and places, the emotions you felt, who and what you loved, when all that is gone, faded, what will you have left?”"
"hotel-california_19406_19478","“You can't hold on forever, even if you don't ever, ever want to forget."

"hotel-california_19864_19910","I wondered how long Ray had been on this ship."
"hotel-california_19911_20007","I wondered why, if he had such an unpropitious outlook, he hadn't tried to change his situation."
"hotel-california_20008_20093","I wanted to ask, but he was still talking, and I was too self-conscious to interrupt."
"hotel-california_20095_20130","“You can try to hold on,” said Ray."
"hotel-california_20095_20120","“You can try to hold on,”"
"hotel-california_20131_20481","“You can try and try and try. Repeat stories to yourself in the artificial night, sketch faces in your mind. You can make their names your mantra.

"hotel-california_20483_20609","Ray, he said, “If we last forever, if our eyes are the last eyes watching as the stars blink out, it won't mean a thing to us."
"hotel-california_20497_20733","“If we last forever, if our eyes are the last eyes watching as the stars blink out, it won't mean a thing to us. We won't care that we're last and we won't care that there are no more stars. We aren't angels. We're just dumb and lucky.”"

"hotel-california_20821_20845","“How long ago was that?”"
"hotel-california_20846_20861","asked Adrienne."

"hotel-california_20862_20889","“Leaving your wife, I mean."
"hotel-california_20890_20914","Traveling on this ship.”"
"hotel-california_20916_20997","Ray, he looked down at his hands, folded together in his lap, fingers interlaced."

"hotel-california_20998_21013","“I don't know,”"
"hotel-california_21023_21054","We were all quiet for a moment."

"hotel-california_21091_21105","We let him go."
"hotel-california_21106_21113","Silent."
"hotel-california_21114_21129","Self-conscious."
"hotel-california_21130_21233","More excuses were made, and after a few moments, only Adrienne and I were left sitting in the ballroom."

"hotel-california_21282_21303","“What's your theory?”"
"hotel-california_21304_21317","she asked me."

"hotel-california_21332_21362","“How long have you been here?”"
"hotel-california_21364_21388","“Not that long,” I said."
"hotel-california_21364_21380","“Not that long,”"
"hotel-california_21389_21437","“A couple weeks, I guess. Maybe a month or two.”"
"hotel-california_21389_21414","“A couple weeks, I guess."

"hotel-california_21439_21469","“Why don't you know for sure?”"
"hotel-california_21470_21480","she asked."
"hotel-california_21482_21493","I shrugged."
"hotel-california_21494_21522","I hadn't been counting days."
"hotel-california_21524_21574","“What did you do before this? How were you found?”"
"hotel-california_21524_21553","“What did you do before this?"
"hotel-california_21554_21574","How were you found?”"
"hotel-california_21576_21596","“I was an engineer.”"
"hotel-california_21597_21658","I explained how my ship had malfunctioned, no warning at all."
"hotel-california_21659_21697","The explosions, the impossible rescue."
"hotel-california_21698_21749","“I don't know how Jefferson knew to find me there.”"
"hotel-california_21751_21762","She nodded."
"hotel-california_21763_21880","“The ship I was on, I guess that's what happened, too. Some vital part broke, and... well, boom. It was all so fast.”"
"hotel-california_21763_21817","“The ship I was on, I guess that's what happened, too."
"hotel-california_21818_21847","Some vital part broke, and..."

"hotel-california_21860_21880","It was all so fast.”"
"hotel-california_21881_22026","She took a sip of her drink, plain water because, she had explained earlier, she had never liked the taste of alcohol, then fixed her gaze on me."
"hotel-california_22027_22066","“I'm going to figure it out,” she said."
"hotel-california_22027_22056","“I'm going to figure it out,”"

"hotel-california_22098_22153","I'll figure it out, then I'm going to find a way home.”"
"hotel-california_22155_22199","I paced my room that night, unable to sleep."
"hotel-california_22200_22258","The more I thought about it, the less sense the ship made."
"hotel-california_22259_22324","Worse, Adrienne had made this clear to me with a single question."
"hotel-california_22325_22387","I had spent weeks asking nothing, contentedly getting nowhere."
"hotel-california_22389_22419","Fact: Adrienne intimidated me."
"hotel-california_22421_22463","Fact: It's too easy to fall into patterns."
"hotel-california_22465_22497","I resolved to break the pattern."
"hotel-california_22499_22602","Another evening, another chandeliered room, another swirl of conversations and dances and hor d'oevres."
"hotel-california_22603_22672","Another circle of chairs and couches, another uncomfortable question."
"hotel-california_22674_22697","“Has anyone ever left?”"
"hotel-california_22698_22736","Adrienne looked at each of us in turn."
"hotel-california_22738_22772","Ray exchanged a glance with Zheng."
"hotel-california_22774_22788","Sarah frowned."
"hotel-california_22789_22875","“Now that you mention it, I haven't seen Alexis in days. I assumed he was indisposed.”"
"hotel-california_22789_22845","“Now that you mention it, I haven't seen Alexis in days."
"hotel-california_22846_22875","I assumed he was indisposed.”"
"hotel-california_22876_22904","Kishori nodded in agreement."
"hotel-california_22906_22944","I looked at Ray and raised an eyebrow."
"hotel-california_22945_22952","“What?”"
"hotel-california_22954_22997","“Well,” Ray said, slowly, “People do leave."
"hotel-california_22954_22961","“Well,”"
"hotel-california_22980_23092","“People do leave. The approximate number of people at any given event is always the same. But we see new faces.”"
"hotel-california_22998_23069","The approximate number of people at any given event is always the same."
"hotel-california_23070_23092","But we see new faces.”"
"hotel-california_23094_23153","“You're sure it's not just some people being indisposed ? ”"
"hotel-california_23154_23193","asked Adrienne, using Sarah's phrasing."
"hotel-california_23196_23295","Zheng shook his head and picked up a handful of candied pecans from a little dish on the end table."
"hotel-california_23296_23463","“Keep adding people long enough, regardless, you get more overall. A couple people staying in their rooms, even if you switch out the people, won't make a difference.”"
"hotel-california_23296_23362","“Keep adding people long enough, regardless, you get more overall."
"hotel-california_23363_23463","A couple people staying in their rooms, even if you switch out the people, won't make a difference.”"
"hotel-california_23464_23517","He dropped the pecans back into the dish, one by one."
"hotel-california_23519_23541","“So where do they go?”"
"hotel-california_23542_23568","Adrienne focused on Zheng."
"hotel-california_23571_23580","I cut in."
"hotel-california_23581_23638","“Maybe a better question is, does anyone ever come back?”"
"hotel-california_23640_23679","Ray and Zheng exchanged another glance."
"hotel-california_23680_23703","Kishori chewed her lip."
"hotel-california_23704_23743","Sarah shrugged and sipped at her drink."
"hotel-california_23744_23789","After a moment, Ray said, “I don't think so.”"
"hotel-california_23770_23789","“I don't think so.”"
"hotel-california_23791_23812","“Are there patterns?”"
"hotel-california_23813_23828","Adrienne asked."
"hotel-california_23829_23842","“Who leaves?”"
"hotel-california_23844_23896","Again, there was an uncomfortable moment of silence."
"hotel-california_23897_23916","I hazarded a guess."
"hotel-california_23917_23944","“You don't notice, do you.”"
"hotel-california_23946_23969","Sarah looked indignant."
"hotel-california_23970_24077","“Of course we notice. But... well, no one important ever disappears, so it doesn't really matter, does it.”"
"hotel-california_23970_23991","“Of course we notice."
"hotel-california_23992_24077","But... well, no one important ever disappears, so it doesn't really matter, does it.”"
"hotel-california_24078_24163","I could tell she was trying to remember whom she had known who had left, and failing."
"hotel-california_24164_24188","No one contradicted her."
"hotel-california_24189_24223","No one offered a different answer."
"hotel-california_24225_24246","I looked at Adrienne."
"hotel-california_24247_24312","Mission accomplished: Our routine insouciance had been disrupted."
"hotel-california_24313_24335","The scales had tipped."
"hotel-california_24336_24438","Even when the conversation returned to lighter tones, as it soon did, I dwelt on Adrienne's questions."
"hotel-california_24439_24514","From the looks on my companions' faces, I knew they were thinking the same."
"hotel-california_24516_24546","“How long have you been here?”"
"hotel-california_24548_24764","The question, previously posed to me, was presented to the rest of our group (excluding Ray; Adrienne had been tactful enough to wait until he had gone for a refill, recalling the last time the subject was broached)."
"hotel-california_24766_24843","Sarah, she tilted her head and tapped a finger on the side of her wine glass."
"hotel-california_24845_24857","A long time."
"hotel-california_24858_24896","Got to be months and months, at least."
"hotel-california_24899_24964","“You were here before I was,” said Kishori, “and so was Tiffany.”"
"hotel-california_24899_24928","“You were here before I was,”"
"hotel-california_24943_24964","“and so was Tiffany.”"
"hotel-california_24966_24997","I looked at Zheng; he shrugged."
"hotel-california_24998_25125","“Time passes in a weird way here. I kept track for a while—thirty-eight days—but after that... I guess I didn't see the point.”"
"hotel-california_24998_25031","“Time passes in a weird way here."
"hotel-california_25032_25092","I kept track for a while—thirty-eight days—but after that..."
"hotel-california_25093_25125","I guess I didn't see the point.”"
"hotel-california_25127_25158","Fact: Some places are timeless."
"hotel-california_25160_25170","“Why not?”"
"hotel-california_25171_25186","asked Adrienne."
"hotel-california_25188_25217","“Days don't matter,” he said."
"hotel-california_25188_25208","“Days don't matter,”"
"hotel-california_25218_25356","“The eleventh of a month or the seventeenth, whether it's Wednesday or Sunday, summer back on Earth or winter, it doesn't affect us here.”"
"hotel-california_25358_25421","Tiffany nodded, but Kishori spoke before the other woman could."
"hotel-california_25422_25450","“Why are you so interested?”"
"hotel-california_25451_25470","she asked Adrienne."
"hotel-california_25472_25494","Adrienne met her gaze."
"hotel-california_25495_25529","“I don't want to be here forever.”"
"hotel-california_25531_25576","“But we're not here forever,” objected Sarah."
"hotel-california_25531_25560","“But we're not here forever,”"
"hotel-california_25577_25601","“Remember? Alexis left.”"
"hotel-california_25577_25587","“Remember?"
"hotel-california_25588_25601","Alexis left.”"
"hotel-california_25603_25634","“Disappeared,” I corrected her."
"hotel-california_25603_25617","“Disappeared,”"
"hotel-california_25635_25688","“We don't know how or why he left. Or where he went.”"
"hotel-california_25635_25669","“We don't know how or why he left."
"hotel-california_25670_25688","Or where he went.”"
"hotel-california_25690_25714","Zheng looked thoughtful."
"hotel-california_25715_25807","He picked up his glass, swirled the liquid around, took a sip, then set the glass back down."
"hotel-california_25808_25844","He glanced around at the rest of us."
"hotel-california_25845_25868","“Do you want to leave?”"
"hotel-california_25869_25878","he asked."
"hotel-california_25879_25914","“Could you live anywhere else now?”"
"hotel-california_25916_25927","I spoke up."
"hotel-california_25928_25942","“Yes,” I said."
"hotel-california_25928_25934","“Yes,”"
"hotel-california_25943_25972","“I wouldn't miss this, much.”"
"hotel-california_25973_25999","No one else said anything."
"hotel-california_26000_26057","I watched Adrienne's eyes move from one face to the next."
"hotel-california_26059_26162","Zheng, he addressed me again, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees and an intense, steady gaze."
"hotel-california_26163_26206","“You think that,” he said, “but is it true?"
"hotel-california_26163_26180","“You think that,”"
"hotel-california_26190_26338","“but is it true? Would you be happy back in a normal life, working and living and crying in the drudgery of whatever the hell normal is these days?”"
"hotel-california_26207_26338","Would you be happy back in a normal life, working and living and crying in the drudgery of whatever the hell normal is these days?”"
"hotel-california_26340_26356","I didn't answer."
"hotel-california_26358_26400","Fact: It's too easy to fall into patterns."
"hotel-california_26402_26454","Fact: I wasn't sure I wanted the dream stage to end."
"hotel-california_26456_26482","My quarters felt stifling."
"hotel-california_26483_26504","Asphyxiating my mind."
"hotel-california_26505_26698","I sat sideways in the armchair, feet dangling over one arm, neck resting against the other, absently tracing invisible lines between the stars outside my window as I ruminated on the situation."
"hotel-california_26699_26747","The lightscreen had proved singularly unhelpful."
"hotel-california_26748_26964","I inspected the arrays of entertainment options—abstract, old-style flatscreens, engrossing VR flicks and action games, a selection of quondam bestsellers and a few recently released novels hoping to gain popularity."
"hotel-california_26965_27139","There was a schedule advertising upcoming on-ship events, such as dance classes, craft sessions, and discussion groups, and a list of dinner invitations for me to respond to."
"hotel-california_27140_27242","A menu of display options, allowing me to customize all the lightscreen's superficial characteristics."
"hotel-california_27243_27315","A simple contact system for communicating with other people on the ship."
"hotel-california_27316_27329","That was all."
"hotel-california_27331_27470","A methodical search of my two adjoining rooms, the ample closet space, and the attached bathroom facility had similarly provided no fodder."
"hotel-california_27471_27716","Furniture (dark wood, expensive, polished, no secret compartments), clothes, leftover tray of half-consumed food from the previous day's lunch, toiletries (complete with miniature bottles of sweet-smelling apricot honey lotion), lightscreen, me."
"hotel-california_27718_27751","I was discouraged and frustrated."
"hotel-california_27752_27845","I wanted to prove to Adrienne that I wanted solve the ship's mystery just as much as she did."
"hotel-california_27846_27930","I wanted to find something, anything, that would prove all this was normal and sane."
"hotel-california_27931_28014","I didn't want to think about disappearances and time and purposes and consequences."
"hotel-california_28017_28046","I wanted my contentment back."
"hotel-california_28048_28089","I cornered Adrienne at dinner that night."
"hotel-california_28090_28330","In one hand I balanced my plate of star-shaped crackers, globs of elegant dips and garnishes, little rolled balls of meats and cheeses stabbed through with spears of some pale green plant, and an array of other delectable, bite-sized items."
"hotel-california_28331_28404","My other hand pointedly steered Adrienne to a small table against a wall."
"hotel-california_28405_28460","She glared at me, but obediently let me pull her along."
"hotel-california_28462_28517","“Tell me,” I said, after we sat, “what you have found.”"
"hotel-california_28462_28472","“Tell me,”"
"hotel-california_28495_28517","“what you have found.”"
"hotel-california_28518_28539","It wasn't a question."
"hotel-california_28541_28629","She gave me a grumpy look that informed me, quite clearly, of her current opinion of me."
"hotel-california_28630_28672","“Not if you're going to be rude about it.”"
"hotel-california_28674_28683","I sighed."
"hotel-california_28684_28692","“Sorry.”"
"hotel-california_28693_28757","I wasn't, not really, but I'd lie to get the conversation going."
"hotel-california_28758_28775","“I want to know.”"

"hotel-california_28834_28904","“I don't know much,” she said, still annoyed but at least cooperative."
"hotel-california_28834_28854","“I don't know much,”"
"hotel-california_28905_29070","She reviewed the information gleaned from our previous dinner conversations, adding, “I heard the captain say something yesterday, as I walking to the Pyrope Parlor."
"hotel-california_28990_29323","“I heard the captain say something yesterday, as I walking to the Pyrope Parlor. I was just coming up on a corner and he was around the other side, talking to a couple people, and they must not have known I was there. He said something about a wreck going well.

"hotel-california_29507_29536","“Is there a doctor on board?”"
"hotel-california_29537_29552","asked Adrienne."
"hotel-california_29553_29582","“I've been having headaches.”"
"hotel-california_29583_29623","It was a lie, but we needed information."
"hotel-california_29625_29642","Jefferson nodded."

"hotel-california_29780_29818","I wondered how many people it treated."
"hotel-california_29819_29868","Had anyone on the ship ever fallen seriously ill?"
"hotel-california_29870_29884","“Does he age?”"
"hotel-california_29885_29900","asked Adrienne."

"hotel-california_30575_30603","“Why doesn't anyone mutiny?”"
"hotel-california_30604_30619","Adrienne asked."
"hotel-california_30620_30693","“If you dislike this place so much, why don't you do something about it?”"

"hotel-california_30717_30736","“What would we do?”"
"hotel-california_30738_30790","Adrienne shook her head and made a sound of disgust."
"hotel-california_30791_30976","“You could force the captain to set down somewhere. Let us off the ship. If he refuses, threaten him. If he still refuses, well, of all of us, isn't there someone who can drive a ship?”"

"hotel-california_31115_31134","Sarah didn't reply."
"hotel-california_31136_31243","I shifted my feet in the plush green carpeting of the Emerald Lounge, looking out the windows at the stars."
"hotel-california_31244_31446","Times like that, running on less sleep than I should, alone because everyone else had had the sense to retire for the night, I had a tendency to get all meditative about the universe and my place in it."
"hotel-california_31447_31502","The stillness of the room contributed, as did the view."
"hotel-california_31503_31622","Black and more black, speckled by tiny points of light that flared up to break the emptiness, if only for a brief time."
"hotel-california_31623_31667","All of it was temporary, save for the black."
"hotel-california_31668_31736","That was tonight's melodramatic theme: the ephemeral nature of life."
"hotel-california_31737_31758","Everything temporary."
"hotel-california_31759_31903","Everything to fade away, lost as dust and scattered atoms between the stars, and every one of us to be left as alone as the moment we were born."
"hotel-california_31905_31975","Thinking about that, I wondered if Sarah's theory was right after all."
"hotel-california_31976_32044","Some things in this world, we have to make them permanent ourselves."
"hotel-california_32045_32077","And Jefferson, he had done that."
"hotel-california_32078_32104","He had made us a constant."
"hotel-california_32105_32144","He made this ship—this life—a constant."
"hotel-california_32145_32174","The one thing that was known."
"hotel-california_32175_32210","The one thing that wouldn't change."
"hotel-california_32212_32284","Maybe everything we did, all the stories we told, maybe it was all lies."
"hotel-california_32285_32409","Maybe we'd never know each other, not truly, because we all hid behind the stories, creating the realities we wanted to see."
"hotel-california_32410_32476","But ultimately, this ship, its purpose, our purpose—did it matter?"
"hotel-california_32477_32504","We each had our own theory."
"hotel-california_32505_32527","Maybe that was enough."
"hotel-california_32528_32596","And all of us, we were permanent characters in each others' stories."
"hotel-california_32597_32626","Maybe that made us more real."
"hotel-california_32627_32660","Maybe it made us feel less alone."
"hotel-california_32662_32683","“Mind if I join you?”"
"hotel-california_32685_32725","I turned to see Adrienne in the doorway."
"hotel-california_32726_32812","She smiled, then crossed the room to join me by the window, not waiting for an answer."
"hotel-california_32815_32876","“Some nights,” I said, “I can't see the meaning in any of it."
"hotel-california_32815_32829","“Some nights,”"

"hotel-california_33068_33156","After all of it, as much as we feared being alone, we feared being vulnerable even more."
"hotel-california_33157_33182","Our instinct was to hide."

"hotel-california_33184_33204","“Look what I found,”"
"hotel-california_33220_33246","In her hands was a bottle."
"hotel-california_33248_33277","And what happens to Adrienne?"
"hotel-california_33279_33299","I couldn't find her."
"hotel-california_33301_33339","Jefferson was in the Captain's Lounge,"
"hotel-california_33342_33369","Fact: Sound is a vibration."
"hotel-california_33370_33568","The speed of sound in dry air at twenty degrees Celsius or sixty-eight degrees Fahrenheit is three hundred and forty-three meters per second, or one thousand one hundred twenty-five feet per second."
"hotel-california_33570_33611","“Up his dosage,” I heard the captain say."
"hotel-california_33570_33586","“Up his dosage,”"
"hotel-california_33612_33646","“I've got a replacement lined up.”"
"hotel-california_33648_33654","I ran."
"hotel-california_33656_33680","I didn't want to forget."
"hotel-california_33682_33712","I didn't want to be harvested."
"hotel-california_33714_33774","The last thing I remember, I was tearing down the corridors."
"hotel-california_33775_33797","Life boats, I thought."
"hotel-california_33798_33824","Every ship had life boats."
"hotel-california_33825_33859","In case of emergency, break glass."
"hotel-california_33860_33873","I'd find one."

"hotel-california_34058_34064","Alone."
"hotel-california_34066_34146","Ray, he caught me as I pounded on the corridor walls, finding no glass to break."

"lw1_1260_1364","Mahogany-black curly hair, cut short in the typical military style framed a careworn, dark-skinned face."
"lw1_1365_1487","It was not an attractive face right now; her ebony eyes shadowed by hours on the watch, full lips pursed with frustration."
"lw1_1488_1540","She had the look of every leader she had ever known."

"lw1_2047_2206","She watched the psi bob her head, unaware of the rest of the bridge, shaking blonde curls as she chattered away with the approaching psi relay on Mason's ship."
"lw1_2207_2308","She seemed so depthless - self conscious and shallow on the outside, but having that incredible gift."
"lw1_2309_2337","There had to be more to her."

"lw1_2915_3115","His silken fur, which would be tawny golden and striped with jet black bands, was dyed perfectly to a pure black, and his mane trimmed and thinned as to be indistinguishable from the rest of his coat."

"Nathans_Bylichka_545_749","When I asked her if she'd ever seen them – before I was old enough to stop believing, I mean – she would always look sad and tell me, ""No, not since the family came to America has anything happened to us."

"Nathans_Bylichka_3714_3798","After she paid the driver, she grabbed my arm, laughing, and we ran down the street."
"Nathans_Bylichka_3799_3825","I heard the pulse already."
"Nathans_Bylichka_3826_4024","We slammed against the doorway and I was laughing too, the pulse close enough to shake the doorframe and set up vibrations in my chest, Rachel in my arms because she’d used me to soften her landing."

"Nathans_Bylichka_4067_4175","The old vaulted church was stripped down: there was no cloth on the altar, just a DJ’s toolkit and his beer."
"Nathans_Bylichka_4176_4277","Through the dark, I could see three bolts left in the wall from where they’d taken down the crucifix."
"Nathans_Bylichka_4278_4483","A confessional too beaten-up to have been sold was shaking in a way that suggested activity inside, and where the pews had been taken out, a couple hundred people were testifying to the DJ’s moving sermon."
"Nathans_Bylichka_4496_4691","Rachel stepped forward into the crowd while I took a moment to drink in the ceiling’s blue-lit, shadowed vault and the light-catching haze from who-knows-what rising between the DJ and the crowd."
"Nathans_Bylichka_4692_4821","There was a terrific echo, each beat reverberating inside of the next, and the old stained-glass windows rattled in their frames."
"Nathans_Bylichka_4822_4905","On the dance floor, people moved with their eyes closed and their hands in the air."
"Nathans_Bylichka_4918_5012","I danced with Rachel for a while, but then something by the bar seemed to be pulling her eyes."
"Nathans_Bylichka_5013_5087","She told me that she was heading for a drink and slipped out of the crowd."
"Nathans_Bylichka_5101_5184","When she hadn’t come back halfway through the next song, I glanced over at the bar."
"Nathans_Bylichka_5185_5306","It was just a little set-up where someone had stacked a few crates and brought something alcoholic to share, mostly beer."
"Nathans_Bylichka_5307_5428","Rachel was standing with a plastic cup, looking like she was having a conversation, but I couldn’t see anyone else there."
"Nathans_Bylichka_5429_5470","The next time the crowd split, I saw him."
"Nathans_Bylichka_5471_5566","He stood in front of a blue light, so I couldn’t see him clearly, but what I saw was memorable."
"Nathans_Bylichka_5567_5671","He wore a jacket of what might have been blue velvet, and his hair gleamed black against his white skin."
"Nathans_Bylichka_5672_5834","The blue haze seemed to stop just shy of his pallor, setting off his striking face without illuminating its details, and his wrists flashed white in the darkness."
"Nathans_Bylichka_5835_5882","He didn’t move, just stared and held his drink."
"Nathans_Bylichka_5896_5943","The next time I saw them, his mouth was moving."
"Nathans_Bylichka_5944_5975","She nodded and he took her arm."
"Nathans_Bylichka_5976_6110","I watched them through the crush of dancers as they squeezed along the wall, and the feeling came to me that something was very wrong."
"Nathans_Bylichka_6123_6191","Saturday morning, I woke up and saw that she still hadn’t come home."
"Nathans_Bylichka_6192_6298","I called Mitch and our other friends, hoping that she’d crashed at one of their houses, but I had no luck."
"Nathans_Bylichka_6299_6393","A couple of them remembered seeing her leave, but none of them had seen the thin man with her."
"Nathans_Bylichka_6394_6480","I didn’t know how they could miss such exotic features, even in that distorting light."
"Nathans_Bylichka_6493_6528","I caught a taxi back to the church."
"Nathans_Bylichka_6529_6604","It was still a mess, but everything bigger than a soda can had disappeared."
"Nathans_Bylichka_6605_6651","I walked across what had been the dance floor."
"Nathans_Bylichka_6652_6942","The church was completely different now: sunlight fell through the stained glass, catching dust that still hung in the air and sending a dry, healthy warmth into the edges of the room, through the stone and the powdery concrete that had been covered last night by flesh and flashing lights."
"Nathans_Bylichka_6943_7160","I realized that Rachel had disappeared without leaving a clue and I had no way to do anything but wait for her to show up – which, if she were in a situation where I should be doing something, would probably be never."
"Nathans_Bylichka_7173_7258","Standing in the center of the church, I took out my cell phone and called the police."
"Nathans_Bylichka_7259_7316","“I need to file a missing persons report. …Rachel Frieze."
"Nathans_Bylichka_7259_7300","“I need to file a missing persons report."
"Nathans_Bylichka_7301_7316","…Rachel Frieze."
"Nathans_Bylichka_7317_7396","Last night, walking on West 2nd street around – maybe eleven or twelve o’clock."
"Nathans_Bylichka_7397_7402","What?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_7403_7443","…But, sir, this is an unusual situation."
"Nathans_Bylichka_7444_7511","She didn’t come home last night, none of her friends have seen her."
"Nathans_Bylichka_7512_7596","…Sir, if she’s in any danger, it will probably be too late to help her by that time."
"Nathans_Bylichka_7597_7686","My girlfriend has disappeared, I don’t even know where to start looking, and I need help!"
"Nathans_Bylichka_7687_7697","…Yes, sir."
"Nathans_Bylichka_7698_7712","I understand.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_7713_7788","The police wouldn’t file a report for someone who’d been missing overnight."
"Nathans_Bylichka_7789_7808","I closed the phone."
"Nathans_Bylichka_7822_7897","Walking out of the church, a little gust of cold air caught me by surprise."
"Nathans_Bylichka_7898_7944","A cold front must have hit while I was inside."
"Nathans_Bylichka_7945_8097","Glancing down the street, I realized that I didn’t have a friend to drive me home this time, and it was a long walk back to the streets where taxis ran."
"Nathans_Bylichka_8098_8190","I pulled my T-shirt’s sleeves down my arms as far as they’d go, but I wasn’t ready for cold."
"Nathans_Bylichka_8204_8285","Walking didn’t build up much heat; it just moved the air enough to chill me more."
"Nathans_Bylichka_8286_8344","After I’d walked about a block, a car rolled up behind me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_8345_8399","It slowed down as it neared me and I started to worry."
"Nathans_Bylichka_8400_8438","This wasn’t the best of neighborhoods."
"Nathans_Bylichka_8439_8519","I kept my eyes straight ahead and tried to walk more quickly without showing it."
"Nathans_Bylichka_8533_8571","I heard an automatic window roll down."
"Nathans_Bylichka_8572_8622","“Hey,” said a male voice, “do you need some help?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_8635_8651","I turned around."
"Nathans_Bylichka_8652_8742","The man looked over forty, and he was driving a car I’d be afraid to drive on this street."
"Nathans_Bylichka_8743_8785","“It’s a long way to anywhere worth going,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_8786_8794","he said."
"Nathans_Bylichka_8795_8822","“Would you like some help?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_8835_8911","“Ah, I think I’m fine, thanks,” I told him, and turned back to the sidewalk."
"Nathans_Bylichka_8835_8866","“Ah, I think I’m fine, thanks,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_8924_8950","“Really, I’d like to help."
"Nathans_Bylichka_8951_8966","Please, hop in."
"Nathans_Bylichka_8967_9008","You don’t look dressed for this weather.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_9021_9053","I glanced back over my shoulder."
"Nathans_Bylichka_9054_9070","“No thanks, sir!"
"Nathans_Bylichka_9071_9085","I’m just fine."
"Nathans_Bylichka_9086_9116","Really, don’t worry about me.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_9129_9163","“Nathan Spencer, I offer you help."
"Nathans_Bylichka_9164_9210","I advise that you not refuse me a third time.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_9223_9267","I stopped and looked back at him, surprised."
"Nathans_Bylichka_9268_9290","He met my eyes coolly."
"Nathans_Bylichka_9291_9317","“How do you know my name?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_9330_9350","“I know your family."
"Nathans_Bylichka_9351_9358","Get in."
"Nathans_Bylichka_9359_9422","We have a lot of work ahead of us, and it’s best to start now.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_9435_9491","I walked around the car and got into the passenger seat."
"Nathans_Bylichka_9492_9541","Before I had my belt on, we were rolling forward."
"Nathans_Bylichka_9542_9557","“Okay,” I said."
"Nathans_Bylichka_9542_9549","“Okay,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_9558_9574","“I’m in the car."
"Nathans_Bylichka_9575_9668","Now, will you tell me how you know my family, and how you happened to be driving by just now?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_9669_9724","In fact, why didn’t you call me by name the first time?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_9725_9762","And how did you recognize me when – ”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_9775_9790","“That’s enough!"
"Nathans_Bylichka_9791_9832","I can only answer one question at a time."
"Nathans_Bylichka_9833_9921","I know your family because an ancestor of mine made a bargain with an ancestor of yours."
"Nathans_Bylichka_9922_9995","I am here now because you called for help, and no-one else would answer.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_9996_10042","He turned onto the next street and shifted up."
"Nathans_Bylichka_10043_10077","“I will help you find your Rachel."
"Nathans_Bylichka_10078_10146","I have to warn you, though, you won’t like what I have to tell you.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_10159_10170","I shivered."
"Nathans_Bylichka_10171_10217","Something in his tone couldn’t be disbelieved."
"Nathans_Bylichka_10218_10234","“Tell me anyway."
"Nathans_Bylichka_10235_10293","If she’s in trouble, I want to find her, wherever she is.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_10306_10335","My driver took a deep breath."
"Nathans_Bylichka_10336_10469","As he did, his neck stretched in a strange way and I noticed several thin lines, like wrinkles, running across the sides of his neck."
"Nathans_Bylichka_10470_10567","“Nathan,” he began in the way that people speak when they start a long and difficult explanation,"
"Nathans_Bylichka_10470_10479","“Nathan,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_10568_10629","“Rachel met someone last night whom it is best never to meet."
"Nathans_Bylichka_10630_10691","This person, like me, is not a member of traditional society."
"Nathans_Bylichka_10692_10759","You see, Nathan, there is …separate from your society …oh, damn it."
"Nathans_Bylichka_10760_10808","I’ve never had to give this conversation before."
"Nathans_Bylichka_10809_10848","Come on, I have something to show you.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_10849_10929","With that, he made a sharp turn onto a side street that I hadn’t noticed before."
"Nathans_Bylichka_10930_11038","We drove between slummy housing and storefronts so decayed that I couldn’t tell whether they were abandoned."
"Nathans_Bylichka_11039_11165","My driver turned again next to an old warehouse that I might have been in once when Mitch took us to a rave in sophomore year."
"Nathans_Bylichka_11179_11271","In front of a few houses, there were cars parked, but there were almost none on the streets."
"Nathans_Bylichka_11272_11342","Their bumpers looked ready to drop off, and their paint was half smog."
"Nathans_Bylichka_11343_11411","I got a strange feeling that we weren’t supposed to be driving here."
"Nathans_Bylichka_11412_11474","“Hey,” I said, “are you sure that we should be going this way?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_11412_11418","“Hey,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_11427_11474","“are you sure that we should be going this way?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_11475_11485","I mean – ”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_11499_11530","“Just ignore that,” he told me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_11499_11518","“Just ignore that,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_11531_11577","“You’ll be used to the sensation in a moment.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_11578_11605","That just unnerved me more."
"Nathans_Bylichka_11606_11659","As we kept driving, the anxiety grew more pronounced."
"Nathans_Bylichka_11660_11759","I noticed that there were some people on the street, people the same color as the soiled buildings."
"Nathans_Bylichka_11760_11837","Someone standing just in the lip of an alley glared at me with gleaming eyes."
"Nathans_Bylichka_11838_11893","“Okay, this is the spot,” said my driver, pulling over."
"Nathans_Bylichka_11894_11916","He parked and got out."
"Nathans_Bylichka_11930_11968","“Is it really safe to leave the car …”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_11969_12057","he was already walking toward the squat, brick-windowed building we were parked next to."
"Nathans_Bylichka_12058_12176","Glancing back at that gleaming glare, I decided that it might be safer to follow the driver than to wait with the car."
"Nathans_Bylichka_12177_12258","I hopped out, ran after him, and reached him just as he was knocking on the door."
"Nathans_Bylichka_12259_12305","Someone opened it a crack, then ushered us in."
"Nathans_Bylichka_12318_12349","Inside, the building opened up."
"Nathans_Bylichka_12350_12434","The ceiling was high and wooden, and I could see part of a DJ’s booth down the hall."
"Nathans_Bylichka_12435_12485","It looked like we were in the back of a nightclub."
"Nathans_Bylichka_12486_12532","Then I looked down and saw what had let us in."
"Nathans_Bylichka_12533_12550","“Nepthys, my man!"
"Nathans_Bylichka_12551_12560","What up?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_12561_12637","The hunchbacked being who let us in held out a scraggly paw for him to slap."
"Nathans_Bylichka_12638_12684","“Nice, my man,” he said as they clasped hands."
"Nathans_Bylichka_12638_12653","“Nice, my man,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_12685_12703","“Who’s the freak?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_12716_12752","“This is someone from Ivan’s family."
"Nathans_Bylichka_12753_12785","Did I ever tell you about them?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_12798_12850","“Yeah, one time, man, but you were pretty fucked up."
"Nathans_Bylichka_12851_12877","What’s your problem, kid?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_12890_12932","The hunchbacked man came up to my stomach."
"Nathans_Bylichka_12933_13001","His skin was brown and stretched, like some diseased sapling’s bark."
"Nathans_Bylichka_13002_13094","It pulled back around his fingertips, which bore things that might have been nails or claws."
"Nathans_Bylichka_13095_13176","When he grinned, I saw that his teeth were sharp and small, like a hunting cat’s."
"Nathans_Bylichka_13177_13221","Under matted hair, his eyes had slit pupils."
"Nathans_Bylichka_13234_13266","Nepthys quickly answered for me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_13267_13288","“Girlfriend troubles."
"Nathans_Bylichka_13289_13389","She came down here with someone after a party, and I don’t think it was one of your average pixies.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_13402_13410","“Bummer."
"Nathans_Bylichka_13411_13441","So, what’s the cat look like?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_13454_13470","He turned to me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_13471_13517","Nepthys nodded: “It’s okay, you can trust him."
"Nathans_Bylichka_13487_13517","“It’s okay, you can trust him."
"Nathans_Bylichka_13518_13543","That’s why we came here.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_13556_13595","It was easier to talk than to question."
"Nathans_Bylichka_13596_13672","“I …I noticed him from across the room when I was looking around for Rachel."
"Nathans_Bylichka_13673_13817","He was standing right in front of some blue lights, so I couldn’t see him very well, but I noticed the way that the light set off his pale skin."
"Nathans_Bylichka_13818_13905","It almost looked like the light bent around him without actually touching him directly."
"Nathans_Bylichka_13906_13979","He was slim, almost drawn, but he had a kind of … luster to him, I guess."
"Nathans_Bylichka_13980_14048","He wasn’t a person you’d describe with normal adjectives, you know?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_14061_14073","They nodded."
"Nathans_Bylichka_14074_14108","“Oh, totally,” said the hunchback."
"Nathans_Bylichka_14074_14088","“Oh, totally,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_14109_14147","“I get that all the time around here.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_14160_14293","“He was wearing a sort of jacket …maybe blue velvet, I couldn’t tell in the dark, but it had ruffles at the throat, things like that."
"Nathans_Bylichka_14294_14314","He really stood out."
"Nathans_Bylichka_14315_14379","That’s why I couldn’t understand why no-one else remembered him."
"Nathans_Bylichka_14380_14403","He had some rings, too."
"Nathans_Bylichka_14404_14464","I remember that he hardly ever moved, just stared at Rachel."
"Nathans_Bylichka_14465_14513","Even when he talked, he hardly opened his mouth."
"Nathans_Bylichka_14514_14570","I don’t know how he could’ve been heard over the music.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_14583_14613","The two glanced at each other."
"Nathans_Bylichka_14614_14634","“What do you think?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_14635_14655","asked the hunchback."
"Nathans_Bylichka_14668_14751","“I’ve looked into it a little, and I do think we might be dealing with one of them."
"Nathans_Bylichka_14752_14797","Have you seen anyone like that in your club?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_14810_14840","“Not that I can remember, man."
"Nathans_Bylichka_14841_14898","I can send you to a guy who knows all about them, though."
"Nathans_Bylichka_14899_14981","If this cat’s for real, I bet my friend can tell you everything you need to know.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_14994_15019","“You’re a wonder, Dvorov."
"Nathans_Bylichka_15020_15049","We should head straight over."
"Nathans_Bylichka_15050_15085","It won’t be long before nightfall.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_15098_15112","“Oh yeah, man."
"Nathans_Bylichka_15113_15154","Here, let me write down how to find him.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_15155_15274","The hunchback pulled out a scrap of paper and scribbled something on it with his fingernail, then handed it to Nepthys."
"Nathans_Bylichka_15275_15293","“Here you go, man."
"Nathans_Bylichka_15294_15305","Good luck!”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_15318_15334","“Thanks, Dvorov."
"Nathans_Bylichka_15335_15349","I owe you one."
"Nathans_Bylichka_15350_15360","Let’s go.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_15361_15385","That last one was to me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_15386_15430","I waved goodbye to the hunchback as we left."
"Nathans_Bylichka_15431_15555","He gave me a half-hearted wave that made me wonder what exactly we were chasing, and whether I should be wearing body armor."
"Nathans_Bylichka_15569_15650","Back on the street, I began to see things that I had never looked for until then."
"Nathans_Bylichka_15651_15767","Still in my initial shock, I suddenly noticed qualities of the people that my mind hadn’t registered when we parked."
"Nathans_Bylichka_15768_15983","I saw people with skin stretched so tightly across their cheekbones that the corners had broken through – people whose cheekbones had horns growing from them, and people whose skin was gathered back like a ponytail."
"Nathans_Bylichka_15984_16058","The yellow of this sky wasn’t just smog: it had a leeching, heavy dimness."
"Nathans_Bylichka_16059_16139","I saw men three feet tall with dusty black skin and eyes that shed yellow light."
"Nathans_Bylichka_16140_16249","A corpulent, batrachian woman walked along with something on a leash that looked like a massive water beetle."
"Nathans_Bylichka_16250_16414","Leaning from the rough-hewn window of one building on our right was something with long, green hair draped across the seven gangly arms hanging from its windowsill."
"Nathans_Bylichka_16415_16466","Thirty-five thin fingers waved lazily like seaweed."
"Nathans_Bylichka_16467_16532","I noticed when my back hit the wall that I was walking backwards."
"Nathans_Bylichka_16545_16660","“We, and thousands like us, have been living separately as long as there has been a human society,” said my driver."
"Nathans_Bylichka_16545_16644","“We, and thousands like us, have been living separately as long as there has been a human society,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_16661_16759","I noticed that the wrinkles on his neck expanded as he breathed and realized that they were gills."
"Nathans_Bylichka_16760_16930","“We interact with humans, take advantage of them, grant them boons, sometimes even become their friends, but the majority of both societies have little or no interaction."
"Nathans_Bylichka_16931_17051","At this point, we have removed ourselves so fully from quotidian human existence that we are understood to be fictional."
"Nathans_Bylichka_17064_17159","“The only place with any significant interaction between our worlds is on the fringes of yours."
"Nathans_Bylichka_17160_17381","Love-ins, raves, gatherings where society is put on hold and humans open themselves to emotion: that is where entities from this world tend to go when they cross over, and that is where Rachel met someone from this world."
"Nathans_Bylichka_17382_17593","Those of us who live permanently in this world tend to set up in places like this, where the human population is so overwhelming that they won’t be noticed in the right corner, with the right protective spells.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_17606_17679","He took out the hunchback’s directions and glanced at an alley behind us."
"Nathans_Bylichka_17680_17694","“Okay, Nathan."
"Nathans_Bylichka_17695_17728","We should get started right away."
"Nathans_Bylichka_17729_17755","There’s no time to waste.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_17769_17797","He saw that I wasn’t moving."
"Nathans_Bylichka_17798_17937","Setting an arm on my shoulder, he said, “Nathan, what you see here might be frightening, but those things you saw are people just like you."
"Nathans_Bylichka_17938_18016","They’ll be as surprised to see a human as you are to see men with seven arms.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_18029_18037","“Thanks."
"Nathans_Bylichka_18038_18110","It’s very reassuring that I’ll not only be an outsider but a curiosity.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_18123_18203","“Nathan, you told me five minutes ago that you would do anything to help Rachel."
"Nathans_Bylichka_18204_18245","Well, she’s here and she needs your help."
"Nathans_Bylichka_18246_18300","Now, the more we can do before nightfall, the better.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_18313_18346","“But why are you even helping me?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_18347_18434","Until thirty seconds ago, I didn’t believe in magic or any of that kind of …weirdness.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_18448_18497","“Nathan, I told you: my family owes yours a debt."
"Nathans_Bylichka_18498_18537","In this world, one’s word is a promise."
"Nathans_Bylichka_18538_18561","Now, can we get going?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_18574_18634","I caught my breath and forced myself to look him in the eye."
"Nathans_Bylichka_18635_18692","“Only if you stop beginning every sentence with my name.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_18705_18724","“You’ve got a deal."
"Nathans_Bylichka_18725_18735","Let’s go.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_18748_18816","As we headed down the sidewalk, I said, “What is your name, anyway?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_18788_18816","“What is your name, anyway?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_18829_18874","“That’s a question you learn not to ask here."
"Nathans_Bylichka_18875_18908","What you may call me is Nepthys.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_18921_19023","Holding Dvorov’s directions, Nepthys took us around the corner of the building into a skinny alleyway."
"Nathans_Bylichka_19024_19091","I started wondering again how reliable my guide’s credentials were."
"Nathans_Bylichka_19092_19222","Walking through an alley with rubbish piles that occasionally skittered from one wall to the other, he did not inspire confidence."
"Nathans_Bylichka_19235_19396","“Just at this corner,” he said, interrupting my immanent panic attack, “we’re going to stop and turn three times widdersh – er, counterclockwise, then face east."
"Nathans_Bylichka_19235_19257","“Just at this corner,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_19306_19396","“we’re going to stop and turn three times widdersh – er, counterclockwise, then face east."
"Nathans_Bylichka_19397_19415","East is that way.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_19416_19452","He pointed at the wall to our right."
"Nathans_Bylichka_19453_19481","“Don’t let the sun fool you."
"Nathans_Bylichka_19482_19553","Then I’m going to shed a little blood, but don’t worry, none of yours.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_19554_19625","I blinked at him, but he just kept walking until we reached the corner."
"Nathans_Bylichka_19626_19694","“Okay, you might feel silly, but just turn three times to your left."
"Nathans_Bylichka_19695_19724","Try to keep in time with me.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_19725_19845","We spun around three times, and then something flashed across Nepthys’ hand and he shook a spray of blood onto the dust."
"Nathans_Bylichka_19846_19924","The blood flashed into flames as soon as it hit the ground, and I jumped back."
"Nathans_Bylichka_19925_20022","When it had all burnt, a thin outline of a doorframe appeared on the wall across from our corner."
"Nathans_Bylichka_20023_20106","Nepthys walked towards it and pressed his bloody palm against it, opening the door."
"Nathans_Bylichka_20107_20124","“Are you coming?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_20137_20264","We slipped through the door and came out, not inside the building, but on a busy street in a completely different part of town."
"Nathans_Bylichka_20265_20408","The sky, cupping over squat buildings, was less yellow here, and stands were set up everywhere the way I’d picture a market in the Middle East."
"Nathans_Bylichka_20409_20495","Nepthys took us immediately to the right, where he led us to a cart filled with herbs."
"Nathans_Bylichka_20496_20587","Spiced air hanging around the cart carried tarragon, rosemary, and scents I couldn’t place."
"Nathans_Bylichka_20588_20750","The thing tending the cart reminded me of the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland: it had the same opium-dream wise man quality I’d always given the caterpillar."
"Nathans_Bylichka_20751_20942","Its arms were thin and long enough to reach any herbs from its cushion in the center of the cart, and with its long, many-shouldered pole of a torso, it rose over our heads even while seated."
"Nathans_Bylichka_20943_21034","Its face was small and wrinkled, with penny-sized smoked glasses balanced on its thin nose."
"Nathans_Bylichka_21035_21090","“Would the gentlemen care to purchase some fine herbs?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_21091_21100","it asked."
"Nathans_Bylichka_21101_21164","“There are no finer to spice a meal, nor purer to mix a potion."
"Nathans_Bylichka_21165_21227","Please, let yourselves breathe the fine scent of these herbs.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_21240_21285","“We’re not here to browse,” Nepthys told him."
"Nathans_Bylichka_21240_21267","“We’re not here to browse,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_21286_21329","“We’d like to see a man about some garlic.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_21342_21360","The thing frowned."
"Nathans_Bylichka_21361_21426","“We have many fine cloves of garlic here on the cart, gentle sir."
"Nathans_Bylichka_21427_21433","If – ”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_21446_21468","“You know what I mean."
"Nathans_Bylichka_21469_21523","Please, if we could see him, we would be much obliged."
"Nathans_Bylichka_21524_21588","I imagine that people do not come here for unimportant reasons.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_21601_21624","It hissed thoughtfully."
"Nathans_Bylichka_21625_21637","“True, true."
"Nathans_Bylichka_21638_21749","Step behind the cart and enter through the door there, using your left hand to open the door and your right – ”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_21750_21783","he looked at me “ – to close it.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_21766_21783","“ – to close it.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_21796_21808","“Thank you.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_21809_21862","Nepthys bowed slightly and we walked behind the cart."
"Nathans_Bylichka_21875_21930","The latch opened under Nepthys’ left hand with a clack!"
"Nathans_Bylichka_21931_21991","The door took us to the bottom of a flight of wooden stairs."
"Nathans_Bylichka_21992_22016","At the top was one door."
"Nathans_Bylichka_22017_22028","We entered."
"Nathans_Bylichka_22041_22100","The room held a bed, a bookcase, and a desk with one chair."
"Nathans_Bylichka_22101_22209","Its only light came from a dying candle on the desk whose spark etched shadows in the roughly planked walls."
"Nathans_Bylichka_22210_22244","On the bed was a small, ratty man."
"Nathans_Bylichka_22245_22283","I smelled matted hair and cedar chips."
"Nathans_Bylichka_22284_22335","He opened one eye when we came in but did not move."
"Nathans_Bylichka_22348_22407","“We’re here for information about a vampire,” said Nepthys."
"Nathans_Bylichka_22348_22393","“We’re here for information about a vampire,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_22420_22431","“Oh, shit!”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_22432_22439","I said."
"Nathans_Bylichka_22452_22464","“Sorry, kid."
"Nathans_Bylichka_22465_22536","–Would you do us the kindness of helping us to identify an individual?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_22549_22598","“Wait, Nepthys – you said nothing about vampires."
"Nathans_Bylichka_22599_22669","Frankly, I don’t know if we can even doing anything against a vampire."
"Nathans_Bylichka_22670_22746","There’s an entire industry in my world based around how unkillable they are."
"Nathans_Bylichka_22747_22812","Are …look, are they as bad as people in my world think they are?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_22825_22839","“I don’t know."
"Nathans_Bylichka_22840_22951","They’re almost as rare here, and I’ve never heard a reliable story of someone successfully fighting a vampire.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_22964_22993","“Only unsuccessfully, right?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_23006_23053","“No, those people don’t usually leave stories.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_23066_23138","“Oh, thanks, Nepthys, for your confidence-inspiring tales of experience."
"Nathans_Bylichka_23139_23199","So they’re probably worse than we think, okay, that’s great."
"Nathans_Bylichka_23200_23324","Now can you tell me what your master plan of attack will be before we go spinning counterclockwise into an Anne Rice novel?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_23337_23484","“My plan is that you shut up while we’re trying to conduct business with someone who might be able to tell us what we’re actually going up against."
"Nathans_Bylichka_23485_23490","Okay?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_23491_23527","Don’t forget, she’s your girlfriend."
"Nathans_Bylichka_23528_23573","Now calm down while I talk to this gentleman."
"Nathans_Bylichka_23574_23616","I can hear your heartbeat from over here.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_23629_23660","I shut up and tried to breathe."
"Nathans_Bylichka_23661_23729","Nepthys turned back to the little man on the bed, who had not moved."
"Nathans_Bylichka_23730_23760","“Please, accept our apologies."
"Nathans_Bylichka_23761_23834","As you can see, our situation is of personal importance to the young man."
"Nathans_Bylichka_23835_23918","Now: may we ask you a few questions about an individual we believe to be a vampire?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_23919_23951","It would be a great help to us.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_23964_24044","The little man drew a few loud breaths that died in the wooden room’s tight air."
"Nathans_Bylichka_24045_24140","Finally, in a pinched rasp, he said, “My information is purely for the purposes of a collector."
"Nathans_Bylichka_24082_24140","“My information is purely for the purposes of a collector."
"Nathans_Bylichka_24141_24201","I do not want to provide help to someone who would do harm.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_24214_24294","“Sir, we simply want to discover whether this individual is, in fact, a vampire."
"Nathans_Bylichka_24295_24380","If there is any boon that you would have us do in return, we would be glad to do it.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_24393_24447","He continued to lie in place, still breathing heavily."
"Nathans_Bylichka_24448_24476","I tried to keep myself calm."
"Nathans_Bylichka_24477_24559","Then, with a sigh, he said, “I have need of a certain stone that I once possessed."
"Nathans_Bylichka_24505_24559","“I have need of a certain stone that I once possessed."
"Nathans_Bylichka_24560_24624","It would allow me to leave this bed, despite my current illness."
"Nathans_Bylichka_24625_24722","My problem is that it was not made in this realm, but by a human, and only a human may handle it."
"Nathans_Bylichka_24723_24775","The herb vendor will tell you where you can find it."
"Nathans_Bylichka_24776_24839","If you would fetch me this stone, I would tell you what I can.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_24852_24913","“Of course we will fetch you the stone,” Nepthys assured him."
"Nathans_Bylichka_24852_24892","“Of course we will fetch you the stone,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_24914_24936","“You have our thanks.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_24949_25020","Outside, the thing at the herb cart nodded when we mentioned the stone."
"Nathans_Bylichka_25021_25103","He told Nepthys the name of a woman who lived on a certain street, and we set off."
"Nathans_Bylichka_25116_25252","When we reached the street, I expected some sort of temple, or a row of antiquaries, or at least a sleazy, black-market relics merchant."
"Nathans_Bylichka_25253_25382","Instead, it looked like we were in the red-light district: women who probably wanted more than our money eyed us from the alleys."
"Nathans_Bylichka_25383_25435","Nepthys didn’t need to warn me not to speak to them."
"Nathans_Bylichka_25436_25608","He took us to the door of a building like a short pagoda that had a sign hanging over it showing a face with hands uplifted, like a saint under G d’s light, and handcuffed."
"Nathans_Bylichka_25622_25710","Inside, the entrance room was hung with bright silks and scattered with velvet cushions."
"Nathans_Bylichka_25711_25864","Sails of obscene orange and a green that insulted springtime hung draped across reds that might have been sensual elsewhere but here were only offensive."
"Nathans_Bylichka_25865_25926","A large woman, similarly decorated, quickly drifted up to us."
"Nathans_Bylichka_25939_25975","“Good evening, gentlemen,” she said."
"Nathans_Bylichka_25939_25965","“Good evening, gentlemen,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_25976_26016","“May I invite you to have a cup of tea?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_26029_26110","“No, thank you,” said Nepthys, “we regret that we cannot take up your kind offer."
"Nathans_Bylichka_26029_26045","“No, thank you,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_26060_26148","“we regret that we cannot take up your kind offer. Are you the proprietor of this shop?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_26111_26148","Are you the proprietor of this shop?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_26161_26187","“Yes,” answered the woman."
"Nathans_Bylichka_26161_26167","“Yes,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_26188_26225","“I am Madame Entera, at your service."
"Nathans_Bylichka_26226_26256","How can I help you gentlemen?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_26269_26312","“We are here to see about a certain stone.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_26325_26347","She raised an eyebrow."
"Nathans_Bylichka_26348_26357","“Are you?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_26358_26415","Well, we don’t get many customers asking about that item."
"Nathans_Bylichka_26416_26439","Please, walk this way.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_26452_26577","She led us past the silks and through an arch decorated with pictures of wooden ships and what looked like African tribesmen."
"Nathans_Bylichka_26578_26735","The next room had mosaics of what could have been Rome, with men in simple tunics working in a vineyard on one wall and men in odd, floppy hats on the other."
"Nathans_Bylichka_26736_26824","After this, we went up a flight of stairs and past a row of doors barred on the outside."
"Nathans_Bylichka_26837_26934","“Excuse me,” I said, ignoring Nepthys’ warning look, “but may I ask what is kept in these rooms?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_26837_26849","“Excuse me,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_26890_26934","“but may I ask what is kept in these rooms?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_26947_26965","The woman laughed."
"Nathans_Bylichka_26966_27010","“Why, the merchandise, of course,” she said."
"Nathans_Bylichka_26966_27000","“Why, the merchandise, of course,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_27024_27055","Nepthys leaned close to my ear."
"Nathans_Bylichka_27056_27101","“This is a slave shop,” he explained quietly."
"Nathans_Bylichka_27056_27079","“This is a slave shop,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_27114_27183","The woman paused before another door, this one not barred but locked."
"Nathans_Bylichka_27184_27359","As she brought out the key, she said, “We deal mostly in fairly mundane trades, but there are a few customers with more unusual needs and people willing to sell unusual items."
"Nathans_Bylichka_27222_27359","“We deal mostly in fairly mundane trades, but there are a few customers with more unusual needs and people willing to sell unusual items."
"Nathans_Bylichka_27360_27435","We’ve had genies, indentured sorcerers, even golems and the occasional elf."
"Nathans_Bylichka_27436_27478","This is one of the stranger items, though."
"Nathans_Bylichka_27479_27562","It’s been in our collection for several years because only a human can activate it."
"Nathans_Bylichka_27563_27674","If we only had a human on our staff, we could have done so ages ago and sold it off, but we have no such luck.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_27675_27785","She opened the door and took us past several doors marked with odd geometrical designs to another locked room."
"Nathans_Bylichka_27786_27809","“Here it is,” she said."
"Nathans_Bylichka_27786_27799","“Here it is,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_27822_27989","With a flourish, she opened the door to reveal a room with walls inlaid with lapis and gold wire, intricate patterns like a Czar’s jewelry box crawling down the walls."
"Nathans_Bylichka_27990_28125","In its center, under a spearing, white light, was a golden table draped with a blue velvet cloth, on which lay a gray, plum-sized rock."
"Nathans_Bylichka_28138_28159","“A marvel, isn’t it?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_28160_28169","she said."
"Nathans_Bylichka_28170_28230","“That such a rock could hold so much magic – it’s a wonder.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_28243_28277","“That it is,” Nepthys assured her."
"Nathans_Bylichka_28243_28256","“That it is,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_28278_28320","“What would convince you to part with it?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_28333_28371","She considered this, looking him over."
"Nathans_Bylichka_28372_28415","“You wouldn’t give me the human, would you?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_28416_28420","No,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_28416_28419","No,"
"Nathans_Bylichka_28421_28497","she said, seeing his expression, “that would make the stone rather useless.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_28454_28497","“that would make the stone rather useless.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_28498_28575","Nevertheless, she gave me what I can only describe as an “appraising glance”."
"Nathans_Bylichka_28555_28574","“appraising glance”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_28576_28622","I have never felt so appraised in all my life."
"Nathans_Bylichka_28623_28685","“He looks healthy,” she said, “how about a pint of his blood?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_28623_28642","“He looks healthy,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_28653_28685","“how about a pint of his blood?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_28698_28706","“A pint?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_28707_28746","Madame, I have his health to consider.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_28715_28746","I have his health to consider.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_28759_28794","“Half a pint, then – and his hair.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_28807_28828","Nepthys turned to me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_28829_28859","“Well, kid, what do you think?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_28860_28889","Remember, this is your quest."
"Nathans_Bylichka_28890_28915","I’m not giving my blood.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_28928_28971","“As if I wanted it,” interrupted the woman."
"Nathans_Bylichka_28928_28948","“As if I wanted it,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_28985_29070","“I think it’s a fair deal, considering the return,” he told me, “but it’s up to you.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_28985_29036","“I think it’s a fair deal, considering the return,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_29049_29070","“but it’s up to you.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_29083_29115","I thought about it, then nodded."
"Nathans_Bylichka_29128_29157","“Marvelous!” cried the woman."
"Nathans_Bylichka_29128_29140","“Marvelous!”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_29158_29247","“One half-pint of human blood, willingly given, and his fine head of hair for the stone.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_29261_29326","She took us downstairs to a small room behind a red silk draping."
"Nathans_Bylichka_29327_29396","There was a wooden chair, where she sat me down and asked me to wait."
"Nathans_Bylichka_29397_29482","Soon, she came back with a lidded ceramic bowl, which she put on the table beside me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_29483_29519","“Roll up your sleeves,” she told me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_29483_29506","“Roll up your sleeves,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_29520_29598","She opened the bowl and carefully, gingerly brought out a fat, dripping leech."
"Nathans_Bylichka_29599_29639","It must have been larger than my finger."
"Nathans_Bylichka_29640_29692","She laid it gently inside the hollow of my left arm."
"Nathans_Bylichka_29693_29868","The cold thing stretched and cast around with its sucker-mouth until it found the soft spot inside my elbow, where it softly sucked on and began to work its way under my skin."
"Nathans_Bylichka_29869_29914","I thought that I could feel a slight itching."
"Nathans_Bylichka_29927_30019","“They take about a quarter-pint each,” said Madame Entera, drawing out another skinny leech."
"Nathans_Bylichka_29927_29965","“They take about a quarter-pint each,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_30020_30040","“They’re quick, too."
"Nathans_Bylichka_30041_30095","We’ll be done with them before your hair is finished.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_30096_30149","Then she clapped her hands and brought in the barber."
"Nathans_Bylichka_30162_30246","Half an hour later, I left the room pale and bald, running my fingers over my scalp."
"Nathans_Bylichka_30247_30284","At least the barber hadn’t nicked me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_30285_30374","Madame Entera took me back up to the stone’s room, where Nepthys was waiting by the door."
"Nathans_Bylichka_30375_30544","“Be careful you don’t let him touch it until you’re ready to use it,” the woman admonished Nepthys as she slipped the stone into a grey cloth pouch and handed it to him."
"Nathans_Bylichka_30375_30444","“Be careful you don’t let him touch it until you’re ready to use it,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_30545_30618","“Thank you for doing business at our house, and I hope to see you again!”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_30631_30694","I left not a little unnerved, and still woozy from the leeches."
"Nathans_Bylichka_30695_30744","“Come on,” said Nepthys, “you could use a drink.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_30695_30705","“Come on,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_30720_30744","“you could use a drink.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_30757_30794","We hit a bar on the next street over."
"Nathans_Bylichka_30795_30908","“Vodka, straight up,” Nepthys told the bartender as we sat down at the counter, “and a Bloody Mary for my friend."
"Nathans_Bylichka_30795_30816","“Vodka, straight up,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_30875_30908","“and a Bloody Mary for my friend."
"Nathans_Bylichka_30909_30931","Make it extra bloody.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_30932_31027","When our drinks came, he poured a dollop of something from an inner pocket into my Bloody Mary."
"Nathans_Bylichka_31028_31056","“That should help,” he said."
"Nathans_Bylichka_31028_31047","“That should help,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_31057_31109","“You could run on empty with a little of that stuff."
"Nathans_Bylichka_31110_31205","It won’t refill your blood supply, but while that’s in your system, you won’t even need blood.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_31206_31223","He grinned at me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_31224_31240","“Drink up, kid.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_31253_31326","I took about half of the Bloody Mary in one gulp and then ate the celery."
"Nathans_Bylichka_31327_31358","Nepthys slapped me on the back."
"Nathans_Bylichka_31359_31459","“Okay,” I said, “now that we’re sitting down, can you explain a little more of what’s going on here?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_31359_31366","“Okay,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_31375_31459","“now that we’re sitting down, can you explain a little more of what’s going on here?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_31460_31496","I mean, what is this place, really?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_31509_31531","He thought about that."
"Nathans_Bylichka_31532_31627","“I think that our world is a reflection of yours, or yours is a more boring reflection of ours."
"Nathans_Bylichka_31628_31664","This place is just a little of both."
"Nathans_Bylichka_31665_31728","In America, things are still weird after the European conquest."
"Nathans_Bylichka_31729_31781","The natives are still here, but so is everyone else."
"Nathans_Bylichka_31782_31869","The Europeans mostly manifest as something like the underground society of your cities."
"Nathans_Bylichka_31870_31929","We aren’t quite what you’d expect from reading the Grimms.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_31942_31961","“What do you mean?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_31974_31993","“Okay, take elves.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_31994_32041","He caught the bartender’s eye for another shot."
"Nathans_Bylichka_32042_32174","“You figure they’re some Lincoln-green pretty boys who run around in the forest with bows and live forever in halls of glory, right?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_32175_32190","Not in America."
"Nathans_Bylichka_32191_32324","Here, they’re the snotty rich who show up in clubs because they like the ‘gritty ambience’ – you have them in your world, too, right?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_32325_32469","Except it’s worse here because they have centuries to grow disaffected and flirt with exciting and dangerous elements of society’s lowest rungs."
"Nathans_Bylichka_32470_32523","Some of them actually commit to this society, though."
"Nathans_Bylichka_32524_32559","There’s an amazing DJ who’s an elf."
"Nathans_Bylichka_32560_32585","He has a real ear for it."
"Nathans_Bylichka_32586_32663","When they do decide to do something for real, they’re always the best at it.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_32664_32690","He downed the second shot."
"Nathans_Bylichka_32691_32757","“I am glad to be out of the favor-trading scene for half a minute."
"Nathans_Bylichka_32758_32798","It’s exhausting to talk to those people."
"Nathans_Bylichka_32799_32877","One wrong word and you find yourself cursed with infinite earwax or something."
"Nathans_Bylichka_32878_32920","So what else do you want to know, Nathan?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_32933_33001","“I don’t know …hey, what about the nature spirits, things like that?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_33002_33056","I mean, where do the dryads fit in a place like this?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_33069_33119","“If the tree isn’t around, the dryad isn’t around."
"Nathans_Bylichka_33120_33144","It’s as simple as that.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_33157_33183","That made me a little sad."
"Nathans_Bylichka_33184_33265","They were always my favorite part of the Greek myths I read in elementary school."
"Nathans_Bylichka_33266_33288","“Well, what about you?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_33289_33317","How did you get to America?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_33330_33387","“My parents came over from Russia, just like your family."
"Nathans_Bylichka_33388_33487","My real name is a little more ethnically appropriate, but we don’t toss those around in this place."
"Nathans_Bylichka_33488_33593","They were spirits of a certain branch of the Volga and the village based around a mill on that tributary."
"Nathans_Bylichka_33594_33762","When the Russian government dammed the river, my parents decided that instead of dying with the river, they would stick with the people of the village they’d protected."
"Nathans_Bylichka_33763_33847","I was born here, and I was lucky enough not to get attached to any particular river."
"Nathans_Bylichka_33848_33936","Sure, I miss having a place to settle down, but it’s better than waiting to get dammed.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_33937_33967","He took another shot of vodka."
"Nathans_Bylichka_33980_34023","“Shouldn’t you be going light on the vodka?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_34024_34073","I mean, we might have a lot of work ahead of us.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_34086_34103","“Are you kidding?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_34104_34133","I can drink like a fish, kid."
"Nathans_Bylichka_34134_34162","We should get going, though."
"Nathans_Bylichka_34163_34176","Still woozy?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_34177_34186","I nodded."
"Nathans_Bylichka_34187_34243","“A little walking should get the stuff into your system."
"Nathans_Bylichka_34244_34263","Come on, let’s go.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_34276_34320","As we left the bar, I asked to see the rock."
"Nathans_Bylichka_34321_34327","“Why?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_34328_34342","Nepthys asked."
"Nathans_Bylichka_34355_34373","“I’m just curious."
"Nathans_Bylichka_34374_34418","I want to see what a magic stone looks like."
"Nathans_Bylichka_34419_34465","Don’t worry, I’ll be careful not to touch it.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_34478_34524","He thought about it, then handed me the pouch."
"Nathans_Bylichka_34525_34615","I undid the strings and let the pouch sit on my palm so that I could see the stone inside."
"Nathans_Bylichka_34616_34696","It looked like a normal river stone, a gray oval with a white stripe through it."
"Nathans_Bylichka_34697_34767","As long as I looked at it, it didn’t reveal any magic sparkle or glow."
"Nathans_Bylichka_34781_34867","Suddenly, what looked like a little kid darted out of an alley and almost ran into me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_34868_34938","I almost tripped over him, and the stone went flying out of the pouch."
"Nathans_Bylichka_34939_34999","Nepthys tried to grab it, but, by reflex, I caught it first."
"Nathans_Bylichka_35013_35093","Immediately, I felt it grow warm and knew that I had done something very stupid."
"Nathans_Bylichka_35094_35168","“Nathan,” said Nepthys, “I think that you just did something very stupid.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_35181_35203","“I agree,” I told him."
"Nathans_Bylichka_35181_35191","“I agree,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_35204_35346","The stone was as warm as human flesh now, and there was a sort of glow that might have been light or just the stone’s soft heat, I don’t know."
"Nathans_Bylichka_35347_35451","Then there was light, a kind of rosy glow, and I felt the stone slip out of my hand to float in the air."
"Nathans_Bylichka_35452_35541","The air around me seemed to still sound, and light came in around the corners of my eyes."
"Nathans_Bylichka_35542_35577","“Do you know what this thing does?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_35578_35616","I shouted, hardly able to hear myself."
"Nathans_Bylichka_35629_35693","Nepthys was saying something that looked like, “I have no idea!”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_35676_35693","“I have no idea!”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_35694_35718","but I couldn’t hear him."
"Nathans_Bylichka_35719_35841","The light in the corners of my eyes rushed in, converging on the rosy glow around the stone, and for a moment I was blind."
"Nathans_Bylichka_35842_35905","Then I opened my eyes again and saw a girl lying in the street."
"Nathans_Bylichka_35906_35937","There was no sign of the stone."
"Nathans_Bylichka_35950_36027","“I think I understand why we got that stone from a slave shop,” said Nepthys."
"Nathans_Bylichka_35950_36013","“I think I understand why we got that stone from a slave shop,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_36028_36165","The girl was as soft and rosy as the stone’s glow, and she was dressed in a white shift tied at the waist with a belt like a Celtic knot."
"Nathans_Bylichka_36166_36285","Her arms and legs were wrapped in white linen up to her wrists and ankles, and soft, white leather boots held her feet."
"Nathans_Bylichka_36298_36360","When she didn’t move, I knelt down and put a hand to her brow."
"Nathans_Bylichka_36361_36438","As soon as I touched her, her eyes opened into mine and she grabbed my wrist."
"Nathans_Bylichka_36439_36455","I couldn’t move."
"Nathans_Bylichka_36468_36488","“Name me,” she said."
"Nathans_Bylichka_36468_36478","“Name me,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_36501_36569","I opened my mouth to ask for an explanation, but Nepthys stopped me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_36570_36612","“Don’t name her ‘What did you say?’, okay?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_36586_36605","‘What did you say?’"
"Nathans_Bylichka_36613_36733","The next thing that comes out of your mouth is probably what she’ll respond to until we figure out how to put her back.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_36746_36762","I was at a loss."
"Nathans_Bylichka_36763_36793","I’d never named anyone before."
"Nathans_Bylichka_36794_36914","I thought back to one time when I’d been thinking about raising a family and remembered that I’d always liked the name –"
"Nathans_Bylichka_36928_36934","“Amy.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_36947_36982","Nepthys looked at me incredulously."
"Nathans_Bylichka_36983_37139","“You awaken a magical being of unknown power from an enchanted stone, having purchased her with your own blood from a slave dealer, and you name her ‘Amy’?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_37140_37257","Amy smiled at me and let go of my arm, but not before she brought my fingers to her lips and gave them one soft kiss."
"Nathans_Bylichka_37270_37303","I stood up and Amy stood with me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_37304_37338","“So …back to our garlicky friend?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_37351_37477","“I suppose so,” said Nepthys, “and you’d better pray to whatever god you think will listen that he won’t care we woke her up.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_37351_37366","“I suppose so,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_37381_37477","“and you’d better pray to whatever god you think will listen that he won’t care we woke her up.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_37490_37523","We walked back to the herb stand."
"Nathans_Bylichka_37524_37677","The vendor stared a little at Amy, his arms pausing in midair as he lit the stand’s little lamp, but we walked right around him and up the wooden stairs."
"Nathans_Bylichka_37690_37807","When Nepthys opened the little man’s door, he rolled over and grinned to see us, but when Amy walked in, he blanched."
"Nathans_Bylichka_37808_37815","“What!”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_37816_37828","he screamed."
"Nathans_Bylichka_37829_37841","“You idiots!"
"Nathans_Bylichka_37842_37857","You woke it up?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_37858_37892","Get out of my sight this instant!”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_37905_37965","“But …but sir,” I said, “are you sure she’s no help to you?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_37905_37920","“But …but sir,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_37929_37965","“are you sure she’s no help to you?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_37978_38046","“Not if you named it already, you ninny, and I’m sure that you have!"
"Nathans_Bylichka_38047_38053","Fools!"
"Nathans_Bylichka_38054_38115","Get out of my sight now – unless you know how to put it back?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_38116_38135","…I thought as much."
"Nathans_Bylichka_38136_38178","Now leave, before I call the rats on you.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_38191_38199","We left."
"Nathans_Bylichka_38200_38273","Nepthys shook his hands at me like he wanted to wrap them around my neck."
"Nathans_Bylichka_38274_38339","“You idiot,” he hissed, “do you know how much you’ve set us back?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_38274_38286","“You idiot,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_38298_38339","“do you know how much you’ve set us back?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_38340_38419","I should say, set yourself back, since it’s your girlfriend we’re looking for.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_38420_38520","I thought about Rachel; in the excitement, I had forgotten why we were chasing down vampire experts."
"Nathans_Bylichka_38521_38574","“You’re just lucky that Dvorov isn’t my only contact."
"Nathans_Bylichka_38575_38603","Come on, we’re heading out.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_38576_38603","ome on, we’re heading out.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_38604_38677","He held the door for me and Amy when we reached the bottom of the stairs."
"Nathans_Bylichka_38678_38741","Walking outside, I was shocked to see that it was already dark."
"Nathans_Bylichka_38742_38816","“Night comes quickly here,” said Nepthys quietly as he came out behind me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_38742_38769","“Night comes quickly here,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_38817_38837","“Didn’t I warn you?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_38850_38931","“Okay,” he said as we hit the street, “we’re going to see another friend of mine."
"Nathans_Bylichka_38850_38857","“Okay,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_38888_38931","“we’re going to see another friend of mine."
"Nathans_Bylichka_38932_38972","First, though, we are getting you a hat."
"Nathans_Bylichka_38973_39013","You look ridiculous with a shaved head.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_39014_39118","At a nearby stand, he grabbed the first hat that would cover my head and might pass back in real Boston."
"Nathans_Bylichka_39119_39199","It was a black baseball cap that read “Dead Can Dance” in gold across the front."
"Nathans_Bylichka_39157_39173","“Dead Can Dance”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_39200_39222","Amy liked it, I think."
"Nathans_Bylichka_39223_39283","She still hadn’t spoken since I named her, so I wasn’t sure."
"Nathans_Bylichka_39296_39387","He took us to a squat, long building whose roof bulged up like the ribs of a gutted animal."
"Nathans_Bylichka_39388_39462","The black door opened as we came up to it, and a pale man opened the door."
"Nathans_Bylichka_39463_39552","He was naked, but there was nothing to hide: his body was hairless and completely smooth."
"Nathans_Bylichka_39553_39613","I only say “he” because he didn’t have a hint of femininity."
"Nathans_Bylichka_39564_39568","“he”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_39614_39634","His eyes were white."
"Nathans_Bylichka_39635_39726","From behind him, I could hear something that sounded like a remix of the Cure’s “A Forest”."
"Nathans_Bylichka_39715_39725","“A Forest”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_39739_39761","“I’m here to see Isis."
"Nathans_Bylichka_39762_39804","Tell her that Nepthys is here to see her.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_39817_39841","The man closed his eyes."
"Nathans_Bylichka_39842_39910","A moment later, he opened them again and stepped aside to let us in."
"Nathans_Bylichka_39911_40024","Nepthys walked straight past him and I tried to keep up, taking Amy’s small hand so that she wouldn’t lag behind."
"Nathans_Bylichka_40025_40116","I shivered as I walked past the pale man’s blank eyes, wondering what they were staring at."
"Nathans_Bylichka_40117_40144","Amy gave my hand a squeeze."
"Nathans_Bylichka_40157_40312","Nepthys lead us down a hallway that matched the building’s façade, a vaulted, ribbed intestine of a hallway, whose black walls looked unsettlingly organic."
"Nathans_Bylichka_40313_40450","I thought that I saw one rib shift in its setting, like a cat trying to scratch its back against a wall, but when I turned, it was still."
"Nathans_Bylichka_40463_40516","Then there was a door, which opened as we approached."
"Nathans_Bylichka_40517_40624","Inside, the space opened into a wide, square chamber mirrored and so dark that it could have been any size."
"Nathans_Bylichka_40625_40721","In the center was a dais covered with white furs and a young woman, surrounded by more pale men."
"Nathans_Bylichka_40722_40752","These were incontestably male."
"Nathans_Bylichka_40765_40775","“Nepthys!”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_40776_40832","said the woman, slithering up across the furs to sit up."
"Nathans_Bylichka_40833_40969","As she rose, her robes fell open and I realized that, except for what looked like a red silk kimono, she was naked – naked and stunning."
"Nathans_Bylichka_40970_41004","I had an urge to cover Amy’s eyes."
"Nathans_Bylichka_41005_41042","“It’s been years since I’ve seen you."
"Nathans_Bylichka_41043_41103","Please, come and sit beside me, and introduce your friends.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_41116_41254","“This man is here in search of his lover, who was stolen from him in the human world,” said Nepthys, ushering us toward the woman in silk."
"Nathans_Bylichka_41116_41202","“This man is here in search of his lover, who was stolen from him in the human world,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_41255_41295","“The girl is …surprising,” he concluded."
"Nathans_Bylichka_41255_41281","“The girl is …surprising,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_41308_41365","“And I am Isis,” said the woman, offering her hand to me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_41308_41324","“And I am Isis,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_41366_41433","I took it and, dropping to one knee, gave her fingers a small kiss."
"Nathans_Bylichka_41434_41456","It seemed appropriate."
"Nathans_Bylichka_41457_41505","“It is an honor to meet you, Lady Isis,” I said."
"Nathans_Bylichka_41457_41497","“It is an honor to meet you, Lady Isis,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_41518_41558","She laughed, liquid, alluring, alarming."
"Nathans_Bylichka_41559_41573","“Oh, precious!"
"Nathans_Bylichka_41574_41637","He has lovely manners, Nepthys, despite his poor taste in hats."
"Nathans_Bylichka_41638_41672","You may leave out the ‘Lady,’ boy."
"Nathans_Bylichka_41673_41727","I don’t wish to be reminded of how old I actually am.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_41728_41804","A wave to the pale men brought a bottle of red wine and a platter of grapes."
"Nathans_Bylichka_41805_41902","“Now, how can I help the elegantly mannered friend of my Nepthys and his surprising young charge?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_41903_41945","I hope I can start by offering some wine.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_41958_41998","Nepthys poured out wine for three of us."
"Nathans_Bylichka_41999_42062","“May I have a little more of what you gave me before, Nepthys?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_42063_42071","I asked."
"Nathans_Bylichka_42072_42102","“I still feel a little woozy.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_42103_42175","He poured a dollop of the clear liquid into one cup and passed it to me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_42176_42333","The wine’s rich scent had a touch of something chemical that I recognized from the bar, but it filled my mouth and sank into my veins with reassuring warmth."
"Nathans_Bylichka_42346_42379","Isis’ nostrils twitched slightly."
"Nathans_Bylichka_42380_42404","“You’ve lost blood, boy?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_42405_42437","This story might be interesting."
"Nathans_Bylichka_42438_42496","Does it have anything to do with why your head is shaved?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_42509_42597","“It was part of the price for this girl, who was a rock at the time,” explained Nepthys."
"Nathans_Bylichka_42509_42578","“It was part of the price for this girl, who was a rock at the time,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_42611_42668","“I have a feeling that she was worth the trade,” I added."
"Nathans_Bylichka_42611_42659","“I have a feeling that she was worth the trade,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_42669_42704","Amy, still holding my hand, smiled."
"Nathans_Bylichka_42717_42764","“She may be at that,” said Isis, gazing at her."
"Nathans_Bylichka_42717_42738","“She may be at that,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_42765_42853","“That sweet, small nose, and her soft lips – she’d kiss well, I should think, if gently."
"Nathans_Bylichka_42854_42890","She has good blood under her cheeks."
"Nathans_Bylichka_42891_42959","Good, round breasts, too, even though they’re small, they suit her.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_42960_43038","Amy didn’t blush, and I hoped that she didn’t understand what Isis was saying."
"Nathans_Bylichka_43051_43191","“She would have been worth it,” Nepthys interrupted, “if this fool hadn’t accidentally woken her up before we could give her to our contact."
"Nathans_Bylichka_43051_43082","“She would have been worth it,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_43104_43191","“if this fool hadn’t accidentally woken her up before we could give her to our contact."
"Nathans_Bylichka_43192_43246","He was going to give us valuable information for her.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_43259_43305","“Now I understand why you’re here,” said Isis."
"Nathans_Bylichka_43259_43294","“Now I understand why you’re here,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_43306_43336","“So what do you need to know?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_43349_43456","“You know I wouldn’t come to you if I could get this information another way,” said Nepthys apologetically."
"Nathans_Bylichka_43349_43427","“You know I wouldn’t come to you if I could get this information another way,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_43469_43488","“Mmm,” she replied."
"Nathans_Bylichka_43469_43475","“Mmm,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_43489_43548","I couldn’t tell what the thoughtful look on her face meant."
"Nathans_Bylichka_43561_43642","“I think that the person who stole the girl we’re looking for might be a vampire."
"Nathans_Bylichka_43643_43700","Isis …you know some way to locate the undead, don’t you?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_43713_43719","“I do."
"Nathans_Bylichka_43720_43744","Describe this one to me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_43745_43775","If I know him, I can find him."
"Nathans_Bylichka_43776_43832","If not, you’ll have to bring me something to work with.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_43845_43866","Nepthys looked at me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_43867_44025","I thought back to seeing the man in the hollow church and described his skin, his dark hair, the way that light seemed to flow around him, as best as I could."
"Nathans_Bylichka_44026_44156","Isis set her elbows in the fur and rested her head on her hands while I spoke and tried not to stare at her full, hanging breasts."
"Nathans_Bylichka_44157_44260","When I had told her all that I could remember, she blinked her black lashes and said, “I remember him.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_44243_44260","“I remember him.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_44273_44282","“You do?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_44283_44316","Nepthys could hardly believe her."
"Nathans_Bylichka_44317_44334","“That’s amazing!”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_44347_44354","“It is."
"Nathans_Bylichka_44355_44398","I would have sworn to you that he was dead."
"Nathans_Bylichka_44399_44412","He should be."
"Nathans_Bylichka_44413_44468","I hope that you can do a better job than the last lot.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_44469_44528","She sat up, running her hands along her pale, round thighs."
"Nathans_Bylichka_44529_44546","“All right, then."
"Nathans_Bylichka_44547_44577","Let me see if I can find him.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_44590_44632","Isis closed her eyes and lifted her hands."
"Nathans_Bylichka_44633_44672","A dark glow coalesced around her palms."
"Nathans_Bylichka_44673_44708","Amy leaned forward, looking amazed."
"Nathans_Bylichka_44709_44803","The glow reflected on her pink face, casting a sickly pallor over her heartbeat-strong cheeks."
"Nathans_Bylichka_44804_44877","Tiny drops of blood began to seep out of Isis’ palms as her brow creased."
"Nathans_Bylichka_44878_44914","Her candy lips twisted into a frown."
"Nathans_Bylichka_44915_45005","The dark glow grew stronger and larger, filling the air for about a foot around her hands."
"Nathans_Bylichka_45006_45067","In her palms, the droplets of blood swelled into small pools."
"Nathans_Bylichka_45081_45166","The dark glow began to flicker, and Isis’ frown of concentration became one of worry."
"Nathans_Bylichka_45167_45202","The pools in her hands grew deeper."
"Nathans_Bylichka_45203_45345","She didn’t shed a bead of sweat, and I didn’t even see her draw a breath, but the glow around her hands shuddered like a stubborn candleflame."
"Nathans_Bylichka_45346_45398","Then her fingers tensed and her arms began to shake."
"Nathans_Bylichka_45399_45457","The blood in her palms, still filling up, began to ripple."
"Nathans_Bylichka_45458_45545","Shivers swept through her body, and Nepthys reached out to touch her but I stopped him."
"Nathans_Bylichka_45546_45651","He glanced at me with honest concern, probably the first honest moment he’d shown me: ‘Is she all right?’"
"Nathans_Bylichka_45632_45651","‘Is she all right?’"
"Nathans_Bylichka_45652_45666","I didn’t know."
"Nathans_Bylichka_45679_45827","Her hands twitched and a drop of blood shook out, splashing on the crease of her thigh and hanging to one strand of the black hair between her legs."
"Nathans_Bylichka_45828_45925","She gasped and the dark glow went out, taking the blood with it in a flash of heat and red steam."
"Nathans_Bylichka_45926_45965","Isis collapsed on the fur, strings cut."
"Nathans_Bylichka_45979_46028","Now Nepthys lunged forward, took her by the arms."
"Nathans_Bylichka_46029_46050","“Isis, what happened?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_46051_46065","Are you hurt?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_46078_46158","She shook her head, rubbing her face into the white fur and murmuring something."
"Nathans_Bylichka_46159_46178","“What did you say?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_46179_46193","asked Nepthys."
"Nathans_Bylichka_46206_46272","She rolled onto her back, her arms crossed tightly over her chest."
"Nathans_Bylichka_46273_46315","For the first time, she looked vulnerable."
"Nathans_Bylichka_46316_46372","When she finally spoke, I had to lean close to hear her."
"Nathans_Bylichka_46373_46457","“I found your vampire,” she said, “but he might know that someone’s looking for him."
"Nathans_Bylichka_46373_46396","“I found your vampire,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_46407_46504","“but he might know that someone’s looking for him. He’s taken great pains to keep himself hidden."
"Nathans_Bylichka_46458_46504","He’s taken great pains to keep himself hidden."
"Nathans_Bylichka_46505_46564","You should look for him at Dvorov’s as quickly as you can.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_46565_46602","She turned to me with tired sympathy."
"Nathans_Bylichka_46603_46633","“I didn’t see a girl with him."
"Nathans_Bylichka_46634_46690","Hurry, though, and you might find him before he leaves.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_46691_46742","A twitch of her fingers summoned her pale servants."
"Nathans_Bylichka_46743_46776","“One of these will lead you out.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_46789_46850","I stood, and one of her servants took me and Amy to the door."
"Nathans_Bylichka_46851_46908","I looked back to see Nepthys whispering something to her."
"Nathans_Bylichka_46909_46984","He stood to go, but she caught his sleeve and pulled him back for a moment."
"Nathans_Bylichka_46985_47011","I turned back to the door."
"Nathans_Bylichka_47012_47058","“Come on, Amy,” I said, “he’ll be along soon.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_47071_47155","Nepthys caught up with us after a minute and walked silently to the end of the hall."
"Nathans_Bylichka_47156_47247","When we got there, another pale servant was waiting for us with a box of dark stained wood."
"Nathans_Bylichka_47248_47343","He offered it to Nepthys, who opened the box: on velvet lining, a wooden hammer and two stakes."
"Nathans_Bylichka_47357_47386","“Mountain ash,” said Nepthys."
"Nathans_Bylichka_47357_47372","“Mountain ash,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_47387_47415","“That was very kind of her.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_47416_47486","Closing the box, he paused beside the open door and looked back at me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_47487_47532","“I really hope we find your Rachel,” he said."
"Nathans_Bylichka_47487_47523","“I really hope we find your Rachel,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_47533_47606","It looked like he was going to continue, but then he walked out the door."
"Nathans_Bylichka_47619_47666","“I know a quick way to Dvorov’s,” said Nepthys."
"Nathans_Bylichka_47619_47652","“I know a quick way to Dvorov’s,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_47667_47735","“I bet he’s kicking himself now for not having a way to contact me.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_47736_47849","In a few minutes, we were back to the first door we’d knocked on in this town and Dvorov himself was greeting us."
"Nathans_Bylichka_47850_47915","The pulse from inside made the building sound like a giant heart."
"Nathans_Bylichka_47928_47944","“Yo, my man Nep!"
"Nathans_Bylichka_47945_47973","You got the sucker already?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_47986_48038","“No, but we got a tip that he might be in your club."
"Nathans_Bylichka_48039_48058","Have you seen him?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_48071_48082","“Here, man?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_48083_48096","You’re crazy."
"Nathans_Bylichka_48097_48178","I haven’t had a vampire here since you and – ” Nepthys shot a wicked look at him."
"Nathans_Bylichka_48179_48204","“Anyway, long time, man.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_48217_48229","“That’s odd."
"Nathans_Bylichka_48230_48268","Do you mind if we check it out anyway?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_48269_48320","I have a real feeling that he’s in here somewhere.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_48333_48384","Dvorov glanced over his shoulder, a little nervous."
"Nathans_Bylichka_48385_48413","“I guess, man, but be quick."
"Nathans_Bylichka_48414_48482","I don’t want my customers thinkin’ that anything’s wrong, you know?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_48495_48506","“Of course."
"Nathans_Bylichka_48507_48540","We’ll be in and out in a minute.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_48541_48605","Nepthys stepped in and Dvorov walked us towards the dance floor."
"Nathans_Bylichka_48618_48673","“So did you get anything out of the guy I sent you to?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_48674_48690","Dvorov asked us."
"Nathans_Bylichka_48703_48772","“No, he said that his research was purely academic, not for hunters.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_48785_48793","“Bummer."
"Nathans_Bylichka_48794_48837","I guess I probably should’ve known, though."
"Nathans_Bylichka_48838_48882","I mean, he is kinda tight about that stuff.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_48883_48913","He didn’t look very surprised."
"Nathans_Bylichka_48914_48952","“Anyway, this is the dance floor, man."
"Nathans_Bylichka_48953_48964","Good luck.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_48977_49106","Something with too many arms was manning the turntables above the crowd, which looked more impenetrable tonight than ever before."
"Nathans_Bylichka_49107_49189","Then I saw the bar on the other side of the crowd and knew where to start looking."
"Nathans_Bylichka_49202_49246","I tried to slip along the edge of the crowd."
"Nathans_Bylichka_49247_49365","Things with scales and claws kept flailing against me, pressing me into the wall, but I took a breath and kept moving."
"Nathans_Bylichka_49366_49408","My nose filled with a reek of thick sweat."
"Nathans_Bylichka_49409_49456","The music began to build, and a strobe came on."
"Nathans_Bylichka_49457_49635","Somewhere toward the center of the dance floor, I heard a howl that sent bitter winds under my clothing – for a second, I was back with my family in Russia, hiding from the cold."
"Nathans_Bylichka_49636_49716","Then I felt a tug on the back of my shirt and noticed that Amy was following me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_49717_49745","I gathered her under my arm."
"Nathans_Bylichka_49746_49826","Dvorov was somewhere behind me, too, negotiating delicately through his patrons."
"Nathans_Bylichka_49840_49935","Just in front of me, a massive thing slammed into the wall, sending up a cloud of granite dust."
"Nathans_Bylichka_49936_49998","It slumped to the floor and I realized that it was a werewolf."
"Nathans_Bylichka_49999_50042","Its haunches twitched in time to the music."
"Nathans_Bylichka_50043_50143","As it started to rise, a man with thick, scaled skin stretched across rippling muscles leapt on him."
"Nathans_Bylichka_50144_50198","I thought that my odds were better on the dance floor."
"Nathans_Bylichka_50211_50372","Holding Amy in my arms as we ducked between the crush of dancers, I started to wonder if the chances of finding this vampire were even good enough to merit this."
"Nathans_Bylichka_50373_50431","I wasn’t sure that I could survive the crush of the crowd."
"Nathans_Bylichka_50432_50585","A cold thing with countless, writhing tentacles fell against me, thrashing as if in the throes of a drug overdose, tripping me and clutching at my limbs."
"Nathans_Bylichka_50586_50704","A woman who could have been an elf twitched and jerked beside me, fingers trembling at the torn edges of her clothing."
"Nathans_Bylichka_50705_50834","Then a looming shape to my right fell away, and I saw him in a flash of the strobe, his black eyes staring deadly into the crowd."
"Nathans_Bylichka_50835_50919","The creature blocking my vision moved back, but I had seen all that I needed to see."
"Nathans_Bylichka_50933_51041","A bleeding, eyeless thing shuddered and beat its arms against me, but I ducked around it and toward the bar."
"Nathans_Bylichka_51042_51220","I slipped past the waving monstrosity that had blocked my view before, a mountain of wet, veined flesh, and had almost passed through the crowd when a clawed hand grabbed my arm."
"Nathans_Bylichka_51234_51248","It was Dvorov."
"Nathans_Bylichka_51249_51284","He pulled my ear down to his mouth."
"Nathans_Bylichka_51285_51308","“You seen enough, man?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_51309_51320","he shouted."
"Nathans_Bylichka_51333_51366","“Yes,” I called back, “I saw him!"
"Nathans_Bylichka_51333_51339","“Yes,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_51355_51366","“I saw him!"
"Nathans_Bylichka_51367_51404","He’s sitting right there at the bar!”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_51417_51510","Dvorov tried to peek through the crowd, but it had shifted again and we couldn’t see a thing."
"Nathans_Bylichka_51511_51560","“I don’t think he’s there,” Dvorov shouted to me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_51511_51538","“I don’t think he’s there,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_51561_51598","“It must have been wishful thinking.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_51611_51626","“No, I saw him!"
"Nathans_Bylichka_51627_51648","I have to hurry, too!"
"Nathans_Bylichka_51649_51688","Who knows how long he’ll stick around?”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_51701_51730","“Listen, man, he’s not there!"
"Nathans_Bylichka_51731_51786","I’m telling you, it’s not even worth checking the bar!”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_51787_51838","I turned to keep going, but he caught my arm again."
"Nathans_Bylichka_51839_51859","“Don’t do this, kid!"
"Nathans_Bylichka_51860_51877","It’s a dumb idea."
"Nathans_Bylichka_51878_51937","Even if you did find this vampire cat, he’d tear you apart!"
"Nathans_Bylichka_51938_51980","If he got your girl, she’s probably dead!”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_51981_52084","I shook him off and squeezed between two dancing nymphs, getting almost to the edge of the dance floor."
"Nathans_Bylichka_52097_52120","Suddenly, Amy screamed."
"Nathans_Bylichka_52121_52192","I whirled around and threw up my arm just in time to knock Dvorov away."
"Nathans_Bylichka_52193_52289","His eyes were glowing red, and he had bared a set of fangs that could probably take my hand off."
"Nathans_Bylichka_52290_52336","The dancers near us tried to clear some space."
"Nathans_Bylichka_52337_52404","He shot back up, hardly touching the ground, and I kicked him back."
"Nathans_Bylichka_52405_52566","He jumped at my arm while I was still off-balance, and I felt the surge of adrenaline that comes right when your body realizes that it’s too late to save itself."
"Nathans_Bylichka_52579_52684","A heavy thing hit my arm with a thump and knocked me back against someone with rough paws who held me up."
"Nathans_Bylichka_52685_52792","On the floor was Dvorov’s head, separated from his body by several feet and a growing puddle of dark blood."
"Nathans_Bylichka_52793_52846","Nepthys stood over him with a blue sword in his hand."
"Nathans_Bylichka_52847_52917","It flashed in the strobe where it wasn’t streaked with Dvorov’s blood."
"Nathans_Bylichka_52930_53007","“He wasn’t the only one with a secret or two,” he said by way of explanation."
"Nathans_Bylichka_52930_52976","“He wasn’t the only one with a secret or two,”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_53008_53041","“You spotted our boy, didn’t you?"
"Nathans_Bylichka_53042_53076","I bet his hide-out is nearby, too."
"Nathans_Bylichka_53077_53090","Let’s hurry.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_53091_53166","He wiped off the sword and sheathed it in a scabbard now belted to his hip."
"Nathans_Bylichka_53167_53191","The crowd parted for us."
"Nathans_Bylichka_53204_53295","The vampire glanced up when he saw the crowd split and his eyes flashed when he noticed us."
"Nathans_Bylichka_53296_53373","In a blink of the strobe light, he was on his feet and dashing from the room."
"Nathans_Bylichka_53374_53384","“Come on!”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_53385_53401","shouted Nepthys."
"Nathans_Bylichka_53414_53470","We chased after him, Amy keeping up valiantly behind us."
"Nathans_Bylichka_53471_53659","He bashed up a set of stairs set into the side of the wall, and we chased up after him, heading up a huge staircase that seemed to go up for more stories than the building could have held."
"Nathans_Bylichka_53660_53712","Luckily, the vampire turned off after three stories."
"Nathans_Bylichka_53713_53829","He ran down a hallway and slipped behind one of the doors, but Nepthys was close behind him and left it open for me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_53830_53936","I called out to Amy to shut the door in case the vampire had any friends who might be trying to follow us."
"Nathans_Bylichka_53937_54010","Inside was a dark room that looked like a storage space for DJ equipment."
"Nathans_Bylichka_54011_54088","Nepthys urged me on from the back of the room, then made a turn out of sight."
"Nathans_Bylichka_54102_54197","When I came to the door at the end of the room, it looked like it had been torn off its hinges."
"Nathans_Bylichka_54198_54290","I didn’t imagine that Nepthys had done it, and it wasn’t without alarm that I ran after him."
"Nathans_Bylichka_54304_54357","A black hallway opened into a space like a cathedral."
"Nathans_Bylichka_54358_54442","The vault rose into obscurity above me, and a massive rose window stood ahead of me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_54443_54525","The panes looked dyed black, and only a few cold beams slipped through the filter."
"Nathans_Bylichka_54526_54621","Footsteps echoed through the stone chamber, and the sound reflected back to me from everywhere."
"Nathans_Bylichka_54622_54694","I couldn’t tell how many people were running, much less where they were."
"Nathans_Bylichka_54695_54803","On the steps in front of the altar, I saw pale forms and realized that they were Rachel and two other women."
"Nathans_Bylichka_54804_54840","Then I heard Nepthys shout, “Nathan!"
"Nathans_Bylichka_54832_54840","“Nathan!"
"Nathans_Bylichka_54841_54853","Behind you!”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_54854_54946","I whirled and dropped in time to see the vampire shoot over my head, leaping like a panther."
"Nathans_Bylichka_54947_55030","He smashed into the pews behind me and I heard him leap across the rest of the row."
"Nathans_Bylichka_55031_55116","There was Nepthys, on the other side of the pews, holding the wooden box in his hand."
"Nathans_Bylichka_55117_55218","He tossed it to me, and I just barely had it open before I saw the vampire again, turning to face me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_55231_55277","I pulled out the hammer and one of the stakes."
"Nathans_Bylichka_55278_55366","He leapt over the pews, soaring like a grasshopper, and drew a gleaming knife in midair."
"Nathans_Bylichka_55367_55434","I dodged, but he tossed it, and I held the box in front of my face."
"Nathans_Bylichka_55435_55533","The blade lodged in the wood, its silver point penetrating the velvet and nearly reaching my skin."
"Nathans_Bylichka_55534_55576","My arms shook from the force of his throw."
"Nathans_Bylichka_55577_55633","Then he landed heavy beside me and I scrambled to stand."
"Nathans_Bylichka_55634_55827","His first move pulled out the dagger, almost wrenching my arms from their sockets as I held on to the box, and the second shattered the box with a crushing punch that sent me reeling backwards."
"Nathans_Bylichka_55828_55946","I dropped the splinters and the broken second stake and raised my hammer, ready to drive the ash spike into his heart."
"Nathans_Bylichka_55947_55998","Behind him, I saw Nepthys running between the pews."
"Nathans_Bylichka_55999_56057","I braced my legs against the stone floor and he was on me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_56058_56169","I raised the stake; he drew back the dagger for a slash that could doubtless open my neck from throat to spine."
"Nathans_Bylichka_56170_56267","The stake went down, there was a blur, and then my hands were empty and I felt pain under my jaw."
"Nathans_Bylichka_56280_56354","Two points of fire opened in my throat for an instant, then all went numb."
"Nathans_Bylichka_56355_56441","Taste, hearing and touch became a single blur, and I do not know if my eyes were open."
"Nathans_Bylichka_56442_56571","My mind began to dissipate, but then I felt the pain withdraw and a lifeless voice said, “This one’s blood isn’t worth drinking.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_56531_56571","“This one’s blood isn’t worth drinking.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_56572_56622","Hands closed on my neck and I felt my spine crack."
"Nathans_Bylichka_56635_56672","I must have fallen to the floor then."
"Nathans_Bylichka_56673_56758","I could perceive Nepthys’ sword flashing over me, and I heard steel crack, then bone."
"Nathans_Bylichka_56759_56816","I thought I heard Rachel’s voice blearily calling for me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_56817_56874","Then one set of footsteps began walking toward the altar."
"Nathans_Bylichka_56887_57054","I was content to let myself drift away, and I had almost forgotten the body lying with broken neck on the cathedral’s hard tiles when I felt a warm touch on its cheek."
"Nathans_Bylichka_57055_57117","A girl’s voice, soft and almost recognizable, spoke, “Nathan.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_57108_57117","“Nathan.”"
"Nathans_Bylichka_57118_57175","I felt my head turn and something in my neck reconnected."
"Nathans_Bylichka_57176_57235","Then my eyes opened and Amy handed me the hammer and stake."
"Nathans_Bylichka_57248_57284","I stood and turned toward the altar."
"Nathans_Bylichka_57285_57332","The vampire was walking just steps ahead of me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_57333_57412","I stepped up behind him and raised my hands, which almost seemed to be glowing."
"Nathans_Bylichka_57413_57508","Then the stake came down into his back and one, two, three strikes with the hammer drove it in."
"Nathans_Bylichka_57509_57573","The vampire fell forward and blood began to flow from his mouth."
"Nathans_Bylichka_57586_57786","Behind me, Amy was kneeling beside Nepthys, whose arm and rib cage were knitting back together like a wooden toy that falls apart when its string is released but draws itself together at a slight tug."
"Nathans_Bylichka_57787_57877","I pulled the vial of liquid that he’d been giving me from his pocket and ran to the altar."
"Nathans_Bylichka_57890_57977","Rachel, her clothes torn and her face drawn, looked like she might cry when she saw me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_57978_58040","I pulled her into my arms and she tried to put hers around me."
"Nathans_Bylichka_58041_58074","“My fuckin’ hero,” she whispered."
"Nathans_Bylichka_58041_58059","“My fuckin’ hero,”"
"The_Black_Willow_60_76","The Black Willow"
"The_Black_Willow_102_159","Allan sat down at his desk and pulled the chair in close."
"The_Black_Willow_160_227","Opening a side drawer, he took out a piece of paper and his inkpot."
"The_Black_Willow_228_354","After filling his pen, Allan looked at his paper in the orange glow from the lantern set back in the desk's right-hand corner."
"The_Black_Willow_355_504","His pen cast a forbidding line of shadow slanting across the page, echoing the inky darkness crouching in the edges of the lantern's struggling glow."
"The_Black_Willow_505_657","The only other illumination came from a lurid moonlight filtered through thin branches and clouds, casting its bone-pale glow onto the pine floorboards."
"The_Black_Willow_670_776","Allan unfolded another page, this one crowded with ranks of letters in tight formation from left to right."
"The_Black_Willow_777_972","The lines of letters stepped into their divisions, in the shape of a story's outline: the loose, dry skeleton of a tale lay exposed beneath their feet, awaiting tendons, muscle and blushing skin."
"The_Black_Willow_973_1265","Allan reviewed the troops, all prepared to disembark, their task to form the tale of a young man returning home from Life Abroad to find his childhood friend a bride to-be, thus upsetting the apple cart of his life's plan, clarified – of course – by his very time away from her he loved best."
"The_Black_Willow_1278_1348","Although the concept was a simple one, Allan thought it had potential."
"The_Black_Willow_1349_1398","Besides, the public liked a good, simple romance."
"The_Black_Willow_1399_1465","Perhaps this will be more saleable, he thought and began to write."
"The_Black_Willow_1491_1616","They gazed at each other, lost in the rapture of love based so deeply within their hearts that they had never seen it before."
"The_Black_Willow_1617_1636","""What about Roger?"""
"The_Black_Willow_1637_1691","she asked, knowing that the answer no longer mattered."
"The_Black_Willow_1717_1789","This is good, he thought, pausing to raise the low light of the lantern."
"The_Black_Willow_1790_1855","I'm almost done, and the happy ending is just falling into place."
"The_Black_Willow_1856_1913","I hardly dare to think it, but – I may finish this story!"
"The_Black_Willow_1926_2022","As he thought this, a sinuous wind encircled the house, slipping through the walls to chill him."
"The_Black_Willow_2023_2197","The papers and the lantern's flame trembled as the thin fingers of a great black willow rapped gently on Allan's window and wall like a stranger knocking on his chamber door."
"The_Black_Willow_2198_2333","This was no stranger, however; the twisted, ancient thing was older than Allan, its branches rapping on his window since his childhood."
"The_Black_Willow_2334_2434","Its thin, drawn fingers framed the bloated moon, whose eerie radiation now bathed the room directly."
"The_Black_Willow_2435_2562","The great, jaundiced eye stared down unblinkingly at the author, who gazed up through his window's tiny frame with trepidation."
"The_Black_Willow_2563_2642","Allan recalled himself and focused once more on the incomplete page before him."
"The_Black_Willow_2643_2699","His pen flickered forth, words dancing out from its nib."
"The_Black_Willow_2700_2778","In the author's eye gleamed the lantern's reflection – or was it a reflection?"
"The_Black_Willow_2779_2953","For while the lantern's spark shivered in the chill breeze, this burn was steady and true as the motion of its owner's pen, scratching out the rhythm of the willow's fingers."
"The_Black_Willow_2979_3107","The frenzied writing ceased at last, the author leaned back with a slight sigh as if both exhausted and satisfied by his effort."
"The_Black_Willow_3108_3169","He held a hand to his forehead, eyes closed and face flushed."
"The_Black_Willow_3170_3197","I did it again, he thought."
"The_Black_Willow_3198_3254","After all that – so near the end, to lose control again."
"The_Black_Willow_3255_3339","His breath returning to its normal rhythms, he dared to look at the page before him."
"The_Black_Willow_3353_3451","His face soft as if caught between a smile and tears, he draped his loose cape over her shoulders."
"The_Black_Willow_3452_3482","""Come, darling,"" he whispered."
"The_Black_Willow_3452_3468","""Come, darling,"""
"The_Black_Willow_3483_3551","""Where I am to take you, one need never think of those left behind."""
"The_Black_Willow_3565_3754","They stepped together into his carriage, her eyes wide with wonder as she touched it and felt, conveyed as if through her skin, the unearthly nature of the rails and reins, the wheelspokes."
"The_Black_Willow_3755_3831","They took their seats within the car and his driver set the horses trotting."
"The_Black_Willow_3832_3938","For a few yards, they kicked up dust along the roadway; then they raised their hooves and took to the air."
"The_Black_Willow_3939_4012","She gaped, afraid but knowing that no harm would come to her by his hand."
"The_Black_Willow_4013_4124","The New England woods disappeared, even the greatest pines shrinking to insignificance as they mounted the sky."
"The_Black_Willow_4125_4205","Above them, the Milky Way drew near as if the stars themselves could be reached."
"The_Black_Willow_4206_4282","A magnificent glow infused the carriage as they merged with the sky's glory."
"The_Black_Willow_4308_4371","Allan crushed the page in his hand and hurled it at the window."
"The_Black_Willow_4372_4422","""Damn you,"" he cried, ""will you never leave me be?"
"The_Black_Willow_4372_4383","""Damn you,"""
"The_Black_Willow_4394_4422","""will you never leave me be?"
"The_Black_Willow_4423_4462","Shall I never finish a story in peace?"""
"The_Black_Willow_4463_4529","He pounded his desk in vain, cursing the foul muse that drove him."
"The_Black_Willow_4555_4636","The next day, Allan sat on a florally patterned chair in a well-furnished parlor."
"The_Black_Willow_4637_4871","Taking a measured sip of white wine from his crystal glass, he glanced at his host – a cultured man dressed in a light suit of the current fashion and wearing his pale hair with a heavy set of sideburns – who passed him a silver tray."
"The_Black_Willow_4885_4905","""Cucumber sandwich?"""
"The_Black_Willow_4918_4960","Allan took a sandwich between his fingers."
"The_Black_Willow_4961_4981","""Thank you, Arthur."""
"The_Black_Willow_4994_5099","Arthur replaced the tray onto the lacquered cherry table that stood in the center of his ordered chamber."
"The_Black_Willow_5100_5185","In a manner delicately balanced between somber and genial, he refilled their glasses."
"The_Black_Willow_5186_5237","""How is the writing these days, my dear Mr. Clemm?"""
"The_Black_Willow_5250_5304","""Perfectly dreadful, my dear Mr. Mason,"" Allan sighed."
"The_Black_Willow_5250_5290","""Perfectly dreadful, my dear Mr. Mason,"""
"The_Black_Willow_5305_5425","""I had a perfect story in my pages; my hero returned home and reclaimed his love, I nearly had it tied together before…"""
"The_Black_Willow_5438_5447","""Before?"""
"The_Black_Willow_5460_5615","""Before that blasted impulse came over me and I started writing like Edgar Poe – though the most recent was not so morbid as my many others, thank Heaven."""
"The_Black_Willow_5628_5704","Arthur's face assumed a long-suffering aspect of authoritative exasperation."
"The_Black_Willow_5705_5821","""I'm not familiar with Mr. Poe's works, but I assume you're referring to your unhealthy penchant for the fantastic."""
"The_Black_Willow_5834_5870","""It's far from a 'penchant,' Arthur."
"The_Black_Willow_5871_6031","This is more like a compulsion, a beast that lies waiting in the dark for the perfect moment, then leaps and takes ahold of me, screaming out through my quill."""
"The_Black_Willow_6044_6066","""How perfectly awful."""
"The_Black_Willow_6067_6108","Arthur grimaced at the vivid description."
"The_Black_Willow_6109_6224","""I'm sure you know that you must curb this behavior if you wish to produce any writing fit for public consumption."""
"The_Black_Willow_6237_6287","""I know,"" Allan replied, ""but how am I to do that?"
"The_Black_Willow_6237_6246","""I know,"""
"The_Black_Willow_6262_6287","""but how am I to do that?"
"The_Black_Willow_6288_6393","You know I do not wish to make my stories thus; but it is my nemesis, confronting me anew at every turn!"""
"The_Black_Willow_6406_6436","Arthur raised a critical brow."
"The_Black_Willow_6437_6555","""Perhaps you could make some headway if you denied your darker side the outlet of the colorful metaphors you so enjoy."
"The_Black_Willow_6556_6753","Every action you take to deny it nourishment will bring you closer to your goal; and believe me, Allan, you must take every opportunity to quash this uncivilized obsession if you intend to publish."
"The_Black_Willow_6754_6832","There simply is no audience for fairy tales – no literate audience, at least."""
"The_Black_Willow_6845_6999","""It is true,"" Allan admitted, fidgeting with his cufflinks, ""that I would not dream of submitting one of these corruptions of literature to any publisher."
"The_Black_Willow_6845_6858","""It is true,"""
"The_Black_Willow_6905_6999","""that I would not dream of submitting one of these corruptions of literature to any publisher."
"The_Black_Willow_7000_7136","I've even tried rewriting the corrupted sections, but once my characters have gone down that road, nothing can recall their former life."
"The_Black_Willow_7137_7232","My prodigal ink-blooded children simply lose their vitality when forced along the proper road."""
"The_Black_Willow_7245_7279","Arthur sighed and sipped his wine."
"The_Black_Willow_7280_7385","""If only you would restrain this morbid impulse of yours, you might write something really worth reading."
"The_Black_Willow_7386_7535","It's hard enough listening to your wild speech without seeing it appear in the refined world of print, like a surly foreigner among a genteel crowd."""
"The_Black_Willow_7548_7627","Allan hung his head, holding his wine with both hands between his arched knees."
"The_Black_Willow_7628_7791","His hair was slightly unkempt after his sleepless night, and his clothing had a rumpled look as if, by mere proximity, it had taken on the aspect of his weariness."
"The_Black_Willow_7792_7862","He scratched the back of his dark-haloed head and blinked bleary eyes."
"The_Black_Willow_7863_7938","""I would drive it out,"" he said softly, ""but I fear for what would remain."""
"The_Black_Willow_7863_7886","""I would drive it out,"""
"The_Black_Willow_7903_7938","""but I fear for what would remain."""
"The_Black_Willow_7951_8011","""Perhaps you require a rest from writing,"" suggested Arthur."
"The_Black_Willow_7951_7993","""Perhaps you require a rest from writing,"""
"The_Black_Willow_8012_8120","""You might find that some time in an honest occupation would ground you somewhat, improve your disposition."""
"The_Black_Willow_8133_8209","""Perhaps it would,"" Allan replied, rising and vainly straightening his suit."
"The_Black_Willow_8133_8152","""Perhaps it would,"""
"The_Black_Willow_8210_8272","""I shall consider it; in the meantime, however, I must be off."
"The_Black_Willow_8273_8315","You have been a gracious host, as always."""
"The_Black_Willow_8328_8359","Arthur rose and shook his hand."
"The_Black_Willow_8360_8432","""So dear a friend is always welcome to my counsel and my home,"" he said."
"The_Black_Willow_8360_8423","""So dear a friend is always welcome to my counsel and my home,"""
"The_Black_Willow_8433_8474","""I hope soon to see you in better sorts."""
"The_Black_Willow_8487_8551","They parted and Allan made his way pensively from Arthur's gate."
"The_Black_Willow_8552_8634","He walked the wheel-ruts, hands in his pockets and unshined shoes collecting dust."
"The_Black_Willow_8635_8707","Some quarter-mile from Arthur's gate, he halted, confronted by a halloo."
"The_Black_Willow_8708_8717","""Nathan?"""
"The_Black_Willow_8718_8750","he called out to the empty road."
"The_Black_Willow_8763_8866","The reply came from above him and Allan turned to see his friend reclining in the fork of a great tree."
"The_Black_Willow_8867_8961","""I had a hunch you'd be at Arthur's today,"" said Nathan, ""so I thought I'd wait here for you."""
"The_Black_Willow_8867_8910","""I had a hunch you'd be at Arthur's today,"""
"The_Black_Willow_8924_8961","""so I thought I'd wait here for you."""
"The_Black_Willow_8962_9061","Nathan's lanky frame, dressed in a loose, tan jacket, fit into the branch like an elegant skeleton."
"The_Black_Willow_9062_9213","His hair fell loosely across a face that seemed always to have a knowing smirk hidden just beneath its surface, infusing his body with a rakish energy."
"The_Black_Willow_9214_9344","""So, Allan,"" said Nathan, unfolding and lowering his legs to the roadside, ""how goes life for the quintessential American author?"""
"The_Black_Willow_9214_9226","""So, Allan,"""
"The_Black_Willow_9289_9344","""how goes life for the quintessential American author?"""
"The_Black_Willow_9358_9441","""I wouldn't know,"" replied Allan dryly, before continuing in another tone entirely."
"The_Black_Willow_9358_9376","""I wouldn't know,"""
"The_Black_Willow_9442_9489","""I destroyed another story last night, Nathan."""
"The_Black_Willow_9502_9550","Leaning against his tree, Nathan shook his head."
"The_Black_Willow_9551_9586","""You mean, finished another story."""
"The_Black_Willow_9599_9620","""Yes, it is finished!"
"The_Black_Willow_9621_9627","Ended!"
"The_Black_Willow_9628_9676","Never again shall it see the rosy-fingered dawn!"
"The_Black_Willow_9677_9724","Nathan, you've read these abominations of mine."
"The_Black_Willow_9725_9791","You know just as well as I that they have no future, no potential."
"The_Black_Willow_9792_9896","At best, they are faery tales; at worst, expeditions into macabre realms no healthy mind need ever see."""
"The_Black_Willow_9909_9946","""So instead, you would write – what?"""
"The_Black_Willow_9959_10019","""Something saleable; something worth reading, worth writing!"
"The_Black_Willow_10020_10171","I want to write as others do: a tale, set in our real world, of characters who might live therein, not citizens of some airy demesne beyond the stars!"""
"The_Black_Willow_10184_10239","""Why is that more desirable than what you write today?"""
"The_Black_Willow_10252_10311","""People will read such stories; they are worth publishing."""
"The_Black_Willow_10324_10393","""If you never finish such stories, how can they be worth publishing?"""
"The_Black_Willow_10406_10468","""That is precisely why I must excise this malignant instinct!"""
"The_Black_Willow_10481_10500","""Why do you write?"""
"The_Black_Willow_10513_10549","""…Why – to earn a living, I suppose."
"The_Black_Willow_10550_10566","Why do you ask?"""
"The_Black_Willow_10579_10679","""You choose to write rather than become a fisherman or a carpenter, though you face such difficulty."
"The_Black_Willow_10680_10693","Why is that?"""
"The_Black_Willow_10706_10748","""I suppose it is because I enjoy my craft."
"The_Black_Willow_10749_10795","I would not be happy, thus separated from it."""
"The_Black_Willow_10808_10898","""So at its heart, then, your writing – as opposed to working otherwise – is for yourself?"""
"The_Black_Willow_10911_10949","""Yes, I suppose one could see it thus."
"The_Black_Willow_10950_11030","But really, Nathan, your queer habits of conversation have reached a new level."""
"The_Black_Willow_11043_11084","Ignoring the statement, Nathan continued."
"The_Black_Willow_11085_11167","""Your writing is for you, Allan, not for the publishers or some imagined audience."
"The_Black_Willow_11168_11329","Since you seem unable to write 'normally,' why not embrace your tales as they are, leave behind the one unhappiness in the art you admit is a source of pleasure?"
"The_Black_Willow_11330_11437","Your stories strike a chord with the deepest, most ancient stories of mankind, the tales basic to humanity."
"The_Black_Willow_11438_11482","Tell them, and they will create an audience."
"The_Black_Willow_11483_11570","You need not pander to what you imagine their wants are; speak, and they shall listen."""
"The_Black_Willow_11596_11663","Allan crouched over his desk once more, pen in hand and mind blank."
"The_Black_Willow_11664_11745","He contemplated a story, an outline he had laboriously constructed some time ago."
"The_Black_Willow_11746_11956","He had filled his pen and raised it, the nib descending towards the paper, before the sound came: the gentle, persistent tapping of the gnarled, primeval willow touching the window with long, insistent fingers."
"The_Black_Willow_11970_12071","His eyes awoke with a passionate, determined flame, though the only light came from the glutted moon."
"The_Black_Willow_12072_12150","Allan filled page after page, the words escaping from his mind onto the paper."
"The_Black_Willow_12151_12323","Where before they had marched in regiments, practiced in ranks and followed their leaders' commands, the words now escaped in their true forms, unhindered by any stricture."
"The_Black_Willow_12324_12455","He continued long into the night, until the eldritch orb had sunk into the waiting hands of the willow, raised perpetually skyward."
"The_Black_Willow_12482_12573","Arthur looked up from the results of a night’s frenzied labors and looked Allan in the eye."
"The_Black_Willow_12586_12601","""What is this?"""
"The_Black_Willow_12602_12660","he queried, indicating the pages he held in his left hand."
"The_Black_Willow_12673_12915","""I decided that… since I wasn't having much success with more – traditional – stories, I might see what sort of work I produced if I let my imagination go freely,"" Allan replied, somewhat less self-assured than he had been the previous night."
"The_Black_Willow_12673_12836","""I decided that… since I wasn't having much success with more – traditional – stories, I might see what sort of work I produced if I let my imagination go freely,"""
"The_Black_Willow_12929_13034","""What in G-d's name could have possessed you to do such a thing,"" cried Arthur, nearly raising his voice."
"The_Black_Willow_12929_12994","""What in G-d's name could have possessed you to do such a thing,"""
"The_Black_Willow_13035_13156","""After all I said the day before, why have you abandoned centuries of literary progress for some self-indulgent fantasy?"""
"The_Black_Willow_13157_13248","He shook the papers at Allan, raising them like a belt above the head of a disobedient son."
"The_Black_Willow_13249_13428","""This is nothing but a glorified Grimm's tale, a miscarried child of Stoker, a creation less fit to be published than to be told around an open fire at the hovel of some peasant!"""
"The_Black_Willow_13429_13567","He spoke the last word with such heavy intonation that Allan shrank back before the physical wave of sound emanating from Arthur's throat."
"The_Black_Willow_13568_13613","""Do you hate the modern system of literature?"
"The_Black_Willow_13614_13709","Do you personally despise the works the Enlightenment or the progress made since Shakespeare??"""
"The_Black_Willow_13614_13707","Do you personally despise the works the Enlightenment or the progress made since Shakespeare?"
"The_Black_Willow_13707_13709","?"""
"The_Black_Willow_13722_13783","For a moment, Allan could hardly do more than shake his head."
"The_Black_Willow_13784_13808","""No, of course not… I– """
"The_Black_Willow_13821_13952","""Then why,"" Arthur barreled on, ""do you disregard them all and return to this superstitious babble, this morbid, paganistic drivel?"
"The_Black_Willow_13821_13832","""Then why,"""
"The_Black_Willow_13853_13952","""do you disregard them all and return to this superstitious babble, this morbid, paganistic drivel?"
"The_Black_Willow_13953_14141","Why do you disregard my warnings, my careful advice given in the best of friendship and designed only to save you from sinking into this very type of corruption, this literary debauchery?"""
"The_Black_Willow_14142_14205","He glared at Allan, eyes impaling him and demanding a response."
"The_Black_Willow_14218_14281","""Could you write decent tales with that willow at your window?"""
"The_Black_Willow_14282_14414","Allan cried out at last, stepping forward and casting his arms open, confronting Arthur with this demanding, pleading interrogation."
"The_Black_Willow_14415_14498","""Its twigs rap constantly against the wall, the wind always demanding my attention."
"The_Black_Willow_14499_14620","How could any writer accommodate the edicts of popular literature with the very forces of nature knocking upon his door?"""
"The_Black_Willow_14633_14824","Arthur looked down his nose at the distraught author, viewing his complaint with pure disdain scantily concealed by the veneer of politeness that animated the construct that was Arthur Mason."
"The_Black_Willow_14825_14833","""A tree?"
"The_Black_Willow_14834_14885","A tree forced you to write this, my dear Mr. Clemm?"
"The_Black_Willow_14886_15003","I must admit, this seems far-fetched, even by your standards – even your Nathan might have difficulty believing you."""
"The_Black_Willow_15016_15081","""You don't know what this is like,"" said Allan, shaking his head."
"The_Black_Willow_15016_15051","""You don't know what this is like,"""
"The_Black_Willow_15082_15119","""Nathan would understand completely."""
"The_Black_Willow_15120_15181","Even as he said it, Allan prayed that his statement was true."
"The_Black_Willow_15195_15329","""Very well,"" said Arthur; ""then take your story to that hedonist and let him defend you when no civilized publisher will approach you."
"The_Black_Willow_15195_15207","""Very well,"""
"The_Black_Willow_15221_15329","""then take your story to that hedonist and let him defend you when no civilized publisher will approach you."

"The_Black_Willow_15385_15444","With that, he tossed the papers at Allan and left the room."
"The_Black_Willow_15457_15526","Stunned, Allan slowly gathered up the pages and placed them in order."
"The_Black_Willow_15527_15729","He then turned and left through the door opposite that Arthur had taken, making his way past his host's doorman without assistance and setting off on foot towards Nathan's residence, several miles away."
"The_Black_Willow_15755_15885","Nathan read the package of words in silence, his only motions the steady progress of his eyes and occasional replacement of pages."
"The_Black_Willow_15886_16079","Allan sat nervously across from him in a chair Nathan had probably upholstered himself, a patchwork design of fabric containing easily more stuffing than any other furniture item of the period."
"The_Black_Willow_16080_16168","At long last, Nathan reached the end and set down his reading on the table between them."
"The_Black_Willow_16169_16204","Allan leaned forward unconsciously."
"The_Black_Willow_16217_16259","""It's the best story you've ever written."""
"The_Black_Willow_16272_16365","Allan exhaled and leaned back into the chair, his face relaxing in imitation of his thoughts."
"The_Black_Willow_16366_16489","""So,"" he asked, ""you don't think it's a waste of ink and paper, a futile expedition into morbidity or literary debauchery?"""

"The_Black_Willow_16382_16489","""you don't think it's a waste of ink and paper, a futile expedition into morbidity or literary debauchery?"""
"The_Black_Willow_16502_16537","""Heavens, no,"" said Nathan, aghast."
"The_Black_Willow_16502_16516","""Heavens, no,"""
"The_Black_Willow_16538_16592","""This is one of the strongest works I've read in ages."
"The_Black_Willow_16593_16681","It speaks to the deepest storyteller's instinct within us all, yet is entirely original."
"The_Black_Willow_16682_16715","My dear friend, you have done it."
"The_Black_Willow_16716_16905","Oh, they may rail against you at first; they may decry you as a heathen or a literary savage; but while those in power say such things, others will read your tales and see their true worth."
"The_Black_Willow_16906_16970","Believe me when I say that you will be read a century from now."""
"The_Black_Willow_16983_17128","Allan, though dubious as to that possibility, felt some temptation from the compliment; mainly, it granted him the encouragement he still needed."
"The_Black_Willow_17129_17291","Nathan promised to show the story to a printer he knew and Allan left it with him, then walked home under the spreading maples with a smile lingering on his face."
"The_Black_Willow_17292_17449","He felt now that perhaps Nathan was right; although the man was somewhat peculiar, he had both an unimpeachable honesty and a certain propensity for insight."
"The_Black_Willow_17450_17523","Certainly, it was undeniable that the stories had an originality to them."
"The_Black_Willow_17524_17621","His mind's strangest fruit had ripened at last, and he found the taste less bitter than expected."
"The_Black_Willow_17622_17706","These thoughts and others like them filled his head as he walked the long road home."
"The_Black_Willow_17719_17801","It was evening, and the sky burned orange in the west when he neared home at last."
"The_Black_Willow_17802_17945","Passionate, fiery colors filled the western sky before him, though the sun itself had reached the trees and a few dark clouds circled overhead."
"The_Black_Willow_17946_18187","As Allan drew closer, he distinguished a new cloud, a pillar rising directly ahead; a road of smoke ascended in the west, its source hidden by the very hillock that concealed his house from the traveler until one had nearly reached its door."
"The_Black_Willow_18200_18288","Allan's thoughts fled as one, scattering on the breeze that scattered the warning plume."
"The_Black_Willow_18289_18503","He ran the last distance, crested the hill puffing to reveal Arthur below, walking to the carriage parked before Allan's house as two laborers wrapped a great saw in oilcloths and loaded it onto the vehicle's roof."
"The_Black_Willow_18504_18609","Arthur paused in the door, looking up at Allan for a moment; then he turned and shut the door behind him."
"The_Black_Willow_18610_18661","The driver snapped the reins and set the horses on."
"The_Black_Willow_18662_18777","As they trotted forth, Allan's eyes remained trapped by the carriage, following it up the hillock and past himself."
"The_Black_Willow_18778_18831","The heavy curtains had been drawn across its windows."
"The_Black_Willow_18832_18943","He watched as the carriage drew still more distant, the horses' hooves still kicking up dust along the roadway."
"The_Black_Willow_18956_19051","When they had gone, he remained, stunned, until the scent of woodsmoke recalled him to himself."
"The_Black_Willow_19052_19147","He turned to regard the pillar still rising behind his house and ran to see what had been done."
"The_Black_Willow_19160_19204","Rounding the corner, he saw a great bonfire."
"The_Black_Willow_19205_19305","A mass of flaming wood stood before him, heat singeing him and sparks flying too close to his house."
"The_Black_Willow_19306_19439","It was a moment before he realized what else had changed: near the wall, beneath his window, was a stump with black and ancient bark."
"The_Black_Willow_19452_19586","In a thoughtless panic, Allan flew to the stream that ran by his house and began frantically throwing handfuls of water onto the pyre."
"The_Black_Willow_19587_19933","His thoughts were not of the act's futility, nor even of the nights spent tormented by the twisted thing; instead, all that filled his mind was the tree's constant presence in his life, growing with him and beside him, its persistent reminders that he had higher, truer things to write, the simple beauty of the great black tree for its own sake."
"The_Black_Willow_19934_20143","His handfuls could do nothing to quench the hewn, burning logs, but when the night sky grew dark above him and the fire dwindled to black ashes, tears threatened to spill forth and extinguish the final embers."
"The_Black_Willow_20156_20176","But he did not weep."
"The_Black_Willow_20177_20324","Instead, he bethought himself of the loss of the tree; considered also Arthur's motivation and whether some good might not come of this, after all."
"The_Black_Willow_20325_20450","Leaving the circle of ashes, he stood and turned towards the woods, in which it was his habit to walk when in a pensive mood."
"The_Black_Willow_20451_20665","He stepped slowly beneath the branches, a gust of wind stirring up the ashes behind him in a great, swirling eddy, a burning brand that rose up and dispersed on the winds as though it were the willow's last breath."
"The_Black_Willow_20679_20832","Allan wandered beneath the trees for a time, thoughts drifting through his mind like great banks of fog, strangely beautiful but impossible to penetrate."
"The_Black_Willow_20833_21069","He considered Arthur's intervention; considered that it might be better to accept the fog and continue as his lifelong friend had suggested, to write stories that others would read; for after all, what purpose writing if not to be read?"
"The_Black_Willow_21070_21151","And without that torturous willow, he might be free to write whatever he saw fit."
"The_Black_Willow_21152_21274","Indeed, if he still could not, he could at any time follow Arthur's advice and seek a profession more grounded in reality."
"The_Black_Willow_21275_21323","Perhaps that would be more healthy for his mind."
"The_Black_Willow_21324_21420","He found himself along the bank of a low, wide stream and allowed himself to follow its current."
"The_Black_Willow_21421_21773","As it turned to the deeper woods, elder giants rose above him: a beech, smooth bark a gray-green pennant hoisted on a slope and standing out between the dark, cracked trunks of the nearer trees; great pines, a few magnificent specimens still bearing the three-stroke symbol of the British King; a towering black birch, leaves impossibly high above him."
"The_Black_Willow_21774_22029","As the stream wound its way through the largest pines, grown so great as to eclipse that feature of the landscape they had once crowded about for sweet water as saplings, Allan continued, slowing his pace to climb across the toes of the slumbering giants."
"The_Black_Willow_22030_22144","There was hardly enough room for his slim frame between the trunks that overshadowed any fleeting mortal trespass."
"The_Black_Willow_22157_22274","Emerging from between the antediluvian trunks, Allan set his feet softly down onto the carpet of needles and stopped."
"The_Black_Willow_22275_22363","Before him, roots imbibing the sweet water of the stream, grew a stand of black willows."
"The_Black_Willow_22364_22580","Fallen trunks lay rotting across the rivulet; the living elders oversaw the grove while younger trees, still small and not yet as knotted and gnarled as their forefathers, sprang up where branches reached the ground."
"The_Black_Willow_22581_22777","Though the elders' trunks fell and died, their children, first roots grown from the very branches that now lay dead, continued unabated, a continuous line from the most ancient of their ancestors."
"The_Black_Willow_22790_22974","Allan stumbled forward, jaw slightly slack, until his outstretched hands encountered the rough bark of a twisted, three-trunked willow whose waists were each larger than Allan himself."
"The_Black_Willow_22975_23330","Collapsing at its base, Allan wrapped his arms around the stoic tree and let forth a moan, a cry of purest agony that escaped him as the first tears seeped from the corners of his eyes and slid down his cheeks, falling to the ground and seeping though the fallen leaves and needles to join the water of the stream, flowing through the ground beneath them."

"110CYL071_55_94","Think of your greatest accomplishments."
"110CYL071_95_168","Think of the joy and success they bring to you and your loved ones."
"110CYL071_175_239","Michael Sims felt that way at age 39 -- the day he earned a job."
"110CYL071_246_283","Michael was born with cerebral palsy."
"110CYL071_284_391","Upon entering the work force, he discovered few job opportunities that seemed to match his abilities."
"110CYL071_398_457","For several years he performed packaging and clerical work."
"110CYL071_458_550","His most recent job lasted only a year before cut-backs eliminated his position."
"110CYL071_557_605","For 18 long months Michael could not find a job."
"110CYL071_606_664","He resorted to public assistance dollars to survive."
"110CYL071_665_698","Finally, Michael called Goodwill."
"110CYL071_705_892","At Goodwill, Michael's counselors felt that his personable demeanor could be a major attribute and identified for him a possible job-match where his people skills could shine."
"110CYL071_899_985","After three interviews, Michael proved that he was the right person for the job."
"110CYL071_986_1107","As the Clubhouse Monitor at Bent Tree Apartments, he now provides customer service for 50 to 60 tenants each night."
"110CYL071_1114_1167","At last, he has found success in a job that he loves."
"110CYL071_1168_1224","Now his goals are set on moving up in the company."
"110CYL071_1231_1280","Every year, thousands of people come to Goodwill."
"110CYL071_1281_1339","Like Michael, they share two common characteristics."
"110CYL071_1340_1405","They face some barrier to employment and they want to work."
"110CYL071_1412_1547","With support from people like you, they can overcome their barriers and earn success and the self-sufficiency that comes with it."
"110CYL071_1548_1607","And then the pay-off begins for the entire community."
"110CYL071_1614_1719","Individual successes at Goodwill mean fewer persons receiving public support and more paying taxes."
"110CYL071_1720_1830","Last year, participants in Goodwill programs earned --and paid taxes on -- wages of nearly $3.5 million."
"110CYL071_1837_1955","Their successes at work also saved taxpayers more than three-quarters of a million dollars in public assistance."
"110CYL071_1962_2031","The savings are counted in more ways than dollars and cents, however."
"110CYL071_2038_2263","The families of the new wage earners may feel the accomplishment in terms of a house to live in, money to purchase food -- without food stamps -- and the beginning of a family focused on success, not hopelessness."

"110CYL071_2583_2616","Your gift will make a difference."
"110CYL071_2617_2795","For every dollar of public support Goodwill received last year, we returned $1.59 to the community in the form of earned wages and reduced public assistance payments."
"110CYL072_18_123","Some of the strongest critics of our welfare system are the people who have become dependent on it."
"110CYL072_130_264","Their complaint: the system discourages working because unemployment provides benefits that many entry-level jobs don't include."
"110CYL072_271_313","That's where you --and Goodwill --come in."
"110CYL072_314_412","We help people train for and find jobs that make it possible for them to get off of welfare."
"110CYL072_413_518","Last year, Goodwill placed 511 people in jobs, more than double the number we placed in 1993."

"110CYL200_72_82","Dear Name:"
"110CYL200_89_209","When Jerry was released from prison, he knew it would take hard work and determination to straighten out his life."
"110CYL200_210_382","He knew he had made a bad mistake, but despite his commitment to rebuilding his life, he just didn't count on the obstacles that would be thrown up in his path."
"110CYL200_389_480","Reality hit when he was unable to reconcile with his wife and ended up on the street."
"110CYL200_481_588","He went to the Center Township Trustee for food stamps until he could find a job and a place to live."
"110CYL200_589_724","The Trustee referred him to the Blue Triangle where he consulted Goodwill's Career Academy staff for job search assistance."
"110CYL200_731_787","Jerry's Goodwill caseworker found him a job immediately."
"110CYL200_788_832","But Jerry's troubles didn't end there."
"110CYL200_833_946","The seasonal construction job he obtained soon ended, and he returned to Career Academy for help once more."
"110CYL200_947_1076","Unemployed, homeless and with a prison record, Jerry now faced going back to prison for failure to pay child support."
"110CYL200_1083_1283","It took some time and hard work, but with the help of Goodwill, Jerry was able to work out a payment plan with the prosecutor's office, find housing and conduct a more thorough job search."
"110CYL200_1290_1428","With unemployment at its lowest point in years in central Indiana, many people still have a hard time finding meaningful employment."
"110CYL200_1429_1568","Of the more than 42,000 people Goodwill served in 1999, over 5,000 of them have multiple barriers to finding and keeping a job."
"110CYL200_1569_1610","Some, like Jerry, are ex-offenders."
"110CYL200_1611_1668","Some are blind, deaf or have other physical disabilities."
"110CYL200_1675_1703","More than 100 were homeless."
"110CYL200_1710_1804","But Goodwill offers hope even to people with numerous obstacles to overcome, like Jerry."
"110CYL200_1805_2047","With a promising new job at a plastic injection molding manufacturer, his legal troubles in check and a safe place to live, Jerry can get on with the business of building a life for himself and contributing to his community."
"110CYL200_2048_2113","For as long as he needs it, Goodwill will continue to help."
"110CYL200_2120_2281","Your support of Goodwill will provide job training and placement services to help the hardest to serve in central Indiana find meaningful employment."
"110CYL200_2282_2388","And, with your assistance, Goodwill can help employers develop resources to keep workers on the job."
"110CYL200_2395_2491","Please make an investment in the stability of our community by sending a gift to Goodwill."
"110CYL200_2492_2541","Your generosity will help people help themselves."

"112C-L012_70_76","Dear ,"
"112C-L012_83_183","Do you remember the combination of elation and apprehension you felt when you first left home?"
"112C-L012_184_255","The young adults who leave Pleasant Run have those same feelings."
"112C-L012_256_305","Very few have family support to get them started."
"112C-L012_312_402","Many need furniture, linens and other basic necessities to begin lives on their own."
"112C-L012_409_634","To help them establish themselves in the community, the Pleasant Run Emancipation fund was begun in 1993 by private donors who wanted to provide a measure of financial support for those leaving our programs."
"112C-L012_641_784","Individuals who are being emancipated are eligible to receive up to $500 from the Fund if they formally apply and meet four requirements:"
"112C-L012_785_815","1. Release by the courts"
"112C-L012_816_865","2. Successful completion of all life skills tests"
"112C-L012_872_930","3. Positive termination of his or her Pleasant Run program"
"112C-L012_931_982","4. Possession of a high school diploma or GED"
"112C-L012_989_1229","Proof of meeting these, two staff reference letters and an essay stating why they should receive a grant and how it will be used are all reviewed by a Pleasant Run panel, which determines if the applicant merits the funds."
"112C-L012_1236_1337","Such fund are often used for college tuition, vocational training or a deposit on an apartment."
"112C-L012_1344_1562","Because Pleasant Run is the only ""family"" for so many, our Emancipation Fund is one way we can help a young person take the first steps into his or her new life as an independent and productive adult."
"112C-L012_1569_1624","Without private donor support, this Fund doesn't exist."
"112C-L012_1625_1768","Please take a few minutes to send a donation to help one or more of our children successfully cross that threshold into the future."
"112C-L012_1775_1785","Sincerely,"

"112C-L013_42_54","Dear Friend:"
"112C-L013_61_149","What kind of people benefit by your contribution to Pleasant Run Children's Homes?"
"112C-L013_156_252","Little ones, like Baby Jessica, caught in the struggle between adoptive and birth parents."
"112C-L013_253_379","Older kids, like Tracy and Kerry, left homeless after a recent murder-suicide in Indianapolis claimed Mom and Dad."
"112C-L013_380_529","Young adults, like Mary T., a jobless mother of three, trying desperately to keep her kids out of trouble in a crime-ridden neighborhood."
"112C-L013_530_542","Real people!"
"112C-L013_549_574","There are thousands more."
"112C-L013_575_652","Families are being torn apart, and too often, children are the victims."
"112C-L013_653_757","Kids like Tommie J., made a ward of the court because of repeated beatings by an alcoholic father;"
"112C-L013_758_841","Alice, sent to a group home to get help because of severe behavior disorders;"
"112C-L013_842_966","and John H., a recovering alcoholic, rebuilding a relationships with his family so they can live together again."
"112C-L013_973_1053","Pleasant Run Children's Homes began serving children nearly 130 years ago."
"112C-L013_1054_1129","Then the task was to help children who lost parents in the Civil War."
"112C-L013_1130_1256","Today, we serve children and families with a multitude of problems: emotional, physical, psychological and sexual abuse."
"112C-L013_1257_1343","Some come from families where, through therapy, there is hope for reunification."
"112C-L013_1344_1448","For others, ""families"" are the counselors are housemates at the group homes where they live."
"112C-L013_1455_1532","The biggest tragedy is that the problems don't go away; they only grow."
"112C-L013_1533_1591","In 1994 Pleasant Run served 346 children and 125 families."
"112C-L013_1592_1655","In 1995 we will serve over 850 children and 340 families."
"112C-L013_1656_1697","In 1996, these figures will triple."
"112C-L013_1698_1850","The children and families who come to Pleasant Run are given the opportunity to become happy, loving, and productive members of our society."
"112C-L013_1851_1963","They welcome the chance to belong, to become self- sufficient, to regain their self-esteem and confidence."
"112C-L013_1964_2039","Often it is a long, hard struggle, but the results are well worth it."
"112C-L013_2046_2161","For Pleasant Run to continue to serve abused and neglected children and their families, we need your support."
"112C-L013_2162_2234","The Funding sources are shrinking, but the needs grow explosively."
"112C-L013_2235_2311","Please ""help good kids get better"" by sending us a contribution today."
"112C-L013_2312_2388","Your gift will give children and families hope for improved tomorrows."

"112C-L014_57_80","This is not newsletter."
"112C-L014_81_109","It is a fund-raising appeal."
"112C-L014_116_194","But there's no reason why we shouldn't share good news at the same time."
"112C-L014_195_327","Federal, state and local governments are freezing or withdrawing much-needed funding sources for people who are truly in need."
"112C-L014_328_554","In spite of that, Pleasant Run Children's Homes, with the help of hundreds of volunteers and others who really care, continues to make a significant impact on the futures of families and kids in need of help."
"112C-L014_561_677","We all hear about today's increases in neglect, abuse and abandonment of those who can't fight back: children."
"112C-L014_678_778","Yet few of us hear enough about kids who live through these adversities and do make the grade."
"112C-L014_785_803","The positive side."
"112C-L014_804_831","These are special children."
"112C-L014_832_878","They come into a Pleasant Run program..."
"112C-L014_879_1063","whether it's for therapeutic help in their own homes (which nurtures whole families), through foster care families or in the familial surroundings of our residential homes."
"112C-L014_1070_1113","For some, it's a matter of weeks or months;"
"112C-L014_1114_1137","for others, it's years."
"112C-L014_1144_1226","They leave Pleasant Run, generally, ready and able to contribute to society."
"112C-L014_1227_1282","We're proud of our children and all that they overcome."

"112C-L015_18_47","Dear Friends of Pleasant Run:"
"112C-L015_54_230","The holiday season is the time of year when we're all busy buying gifts, baking goodies, decorating our homes and making arrangements to be with family and friends."
"112C-L015_231_324","This is the time of year when we give thanks for the warmth and love that surrounds us."
"112C-L015_325_413","And this time of year is an occasion to remember those not as fortunate as we are."
"112C-L015_420_473","Pleasant Run cares for at-risk children and families."
"112C-L015_474_620","We do this through a wide range of programs including community- based, therapeutic foster care, group homes and our treatment center."
"112C-L015_621_695","Many of the children are victims of abuse or live in unstable homes."
"112C-L015_702_858","Today we are asking you to take a few minutes to consider making a contribution to Pleasant Run to help the 1,500 children families we care for."
"112C-L015_859_939","Many of the children have no homes; no memories of joy from past holidays."
"112C-L015_940_1086","Others are from families that are struggling to provide a healthy, happy environment but don't have the resources to make it possible."
"112C-L015_1087_1146","Your contribution will make a difference in a child's life."
"112C-L015_1147_1188","It may help a family stay together."
"112C-L015_1189_1240","It can certainly make happy holiday memories."
"112C-L015_1247_1334","A gift to Pleasant Run means the children in our care will have presents to open."
"112C-L015_1335_1452","A gift means a family will have a holiday meal, cooking utensils to prepare the meal and dishes to serve it on."
"112C-L015_1453_1503","Your gift will go beyond the holiday season."
"112C-L015_1504_1606","It can help purchase clothing, school supplies, books and educational tools throughout the year."
"112C-L015_1620_1681","Please take a few minutes to mail a donation to Pleasant run."
"112C-L015_1682_1813","Let our families and children know that you want them to have the same kinds of memories of the holidays you will have."

"112C-L016_94_189","At Pleasant Run, Inc. we are making plans and arrangements for our children and families."
"112C-L016_196_301","Every year we seek companies, organizations and individuals to sponsor one or more of our families."
"112C-L016_302_372","These families are participants in our community-based programs."
"112C-L016_373_495","These programs focus on keeping the family together by providing counseling and other services to the entire family."
"112C-L016_502_688","After our caseworkers meet with these families and their children they often find they lack even the basic necessities such as cooking utensils, beds, cleaning supplies, etc."
"112C-L016_689_721","We meet these needs immediately."
"112C-L016_722_804","But, the holiday season is a particularly difficult time for these families."
"112C-L016_805_903","They do not have the resources necessary to purchase gifts or food for a holiday meal."
"112C-L016_910_1001","We are asking you to consider sponsoring one of our families for this holiday season."
"112C-L016_1002_1117","If you are interested and would like more information, please contact Lisa Lusk or Marcia Whited at 693-9222."

"113CWL018_597_833","To accomplish this, the five area Boys & Girls Clubs of Indianapolis must be open and available when the kids need them, with the staff and programs the kids need to reach and grow into responsible and caring citizens."

"114CUL059_54_68","What a Summer!"
"114CUL059_75_106","And we're just getting started!"
"114CUL059_113_231","I hope you'll consider continuing your support of Jameson's special campers by renewing your last gift of $ xxx."
"114CUL059_232_298","I can tell you we need your help now as much as ever before."
"114CUL059_305_553","All of our Six summer camping sessions are booked to capacity (and, truth be told, with maybe one our two extra returning campers squeezed in) and we have a waiting list of 60 children who are hoping to come if a spot should open."
"114CUL059_554_688","Many more camper referrals are coming from new organizations such as school social-workers and family counseling agencies."
"114CUL059_689_857","It seems summer options aren't readily available for troubled kids whose families have limited incomes, so we're doing all we can to make Jameson available."
"114CUL059_864_910","That ""we"" includes the Youth Leadership teens."
"114CUL059_911_1020","These 60 or so campers have takenon a fund raiser with a goal of raising $16,000 for camperships."
"114CUL059_1021_1193","Two of them told me yesterday that as a group they decided they had to earn the right to ask others for help by accomplishing something real to help themselves."
"114CUL059_1194_1250","And that's from kids many people see as a problem."
"114CUL059_1257_1457","Even after the summer sessions come to a close, Jameson campers will take part in year-round programs designed to keep that positive contact with peers and role models alive and important."
"114CUL059_1458_1598","We've scheduled more than 15 follow-up camper weekends beginning in September and going around till next summers camping season."
"114CUL059_1605_1670","Please, consider renewing your support of these great kids today."

"114CUL060_315_361","You help Jameson campers reach for them."
"114CUL060_362_503","If these special children are to become the adults we all need them to be, we have to lead them in the right direction right now."

"114CUL060_976_1129","The best indicator I can give you of the positive effect our year-round contact has is the growth in and deeds of the Youth Leadership teens."
"114CUL060_1130_1295","In just the past few years this program has grown from a few kids and a few extra activities to a team of almost 60 young adults taking on real projects."

"114CUL060_1667_1806","The teens have also decided to raise money to provide camperships for other campers because they know what Jameson has meant to them."

"115CVL035_93_342","CCI is a federation of 13 neighborhood-based multi-service centers whose mission is to identify and meet the human service needs of residents throughout Marion County in the most effective, efficient and comprehensive way possible."
"115CVL035_343_553","In 1998, we served a total of 31,484 low-income individuals through job training and placement assistance, youth and senior programming, family counseling, emergency assistance, and much more."
"115CVL035_560_675","As you can see from the enclosed map, your Target store is located in the heart of four of our service areas."
"115CVL035_676_981","The centers that serve these areas, Mary Rigg Neighborhood Center, Hawthorne Community Center, Southwest Multi-Service Center, and Christamore House, have teamed up to run an exciting job readiness program for 14 and 15 year old area residents called the Summer Enrichment Program."
"115CVL035_982_1200","Between June 21 and August 31, 45 youth will spend 20 hours a week developing life management and work ethic skills, learning the computer, visiting area colleges, and interacting with guest speakers."
"115CVL035_1201_1335","The end result will be kids who have a better understanding of and vision for their own future, be it college or a career."
"115CVL035_1342_1444","The Summer Enrichment Program will conclude with a celebration that includes family and friends."
"115CVL035_1445_1583","We would like to offer our youth a small reward for their participation by presenting them with gift certificates from Target."
"115CVL035_1584_1758","Therefore, we are asking you to donate 45, $10 gift certificates that can be used toward the purchase of school supplies or clothing, in the total amount of $450."
"115CVL035_1759_1856","In return, we will recognize Target as a sponsor during our event and in the event program."

"115CVL036_111_158","CCI has come a long way in the last five years."
"115CVL036_159_356","We've worked hard to structrue the organization so that we've ready to move boldly into the next century, and I believe that we have an exciting and successful future ahead of us."
"115CVL036_363_421","One of the areas we've decided to focus on is development."
"115CVL036_422_638","It's clear that if we don't increase our base of private funding, we won't have the kind of control we need to ensure the continued success of our centers and the very important services they offer."
"115CVL036_639_713","In 1998, CCI served 31,484 individuals right in their own backyards."
"115CVL036_714_788","Where else would that many people turn if CCI weren't there to help?"
"115CVL036_795_983","The community initiatives committee is working with our development office to put together a long-range fundraising plan that will ultimately bring more money into our centers."
"115CVL036_984_1067","This in turn will help us to increase and even improve the services we offer."
"115CVL036_1074_1315","With this in mind, I am asking each one of you to make a personal contribution of $50, $100 or even $1,000 to show that you believe in the work that we do and are willing to support it with both your time and your finances."
"115CVL036_1316_1494","This way when we go out to ask for community support and are asked about our board giving level, we can show our in-house commitment through 100% board participation."
"115CVL036_1495_1609","I also encourage you to seek additional support through your company, church, or service organization."
"115CVL036_1616_1741","I know that our staff and committee members will be happy to go with you to talk to these group if you need their help."

"116CUL032_126_310","In 1998, MCCOY, Inc. led two efforts that, we believe, will help our community continue to take the steps necessary to help all young people grow up and develop well."
"116CUL032_317_537","Participants in the Youth Outcomes Educational Initiative identified three goals for all our youth to obtain: economic self-sufficiency, healthy family, social relationships, and involvement in the community."
"116CUL032_538_769","A short time later, the Community Youth Mapping Project sent 55 young people out into the community to identify the resources they need to grow up well: caring adults, safe places to go, and positive things to do."
"116CUL032_776_1088","One group of adults and one group of youth, through two very different processes, have arrived at the same conclusion; our community still has much to do if we are to help ALL of your youth successfully develop into the responsible, productive adults who will our community in the future."
"116CUL032_1095_1211","As a provider of youth services, MCCOY, Inc. is here to support your valuable efforts to develop young people."
"116CUL032_1212_1431","Recently, through a lot of hard work and alliances with organizations like yours, some steps have been taken in our community that will help young people continue to be involved in positive activities."
"116CUL032_1432_1598","One, IndyGo in April adopted a much-needed policy that all young people under the age of 19 may ride on their buses at half the normal fare all year long."
"116CUL032_1599_1751","Two, funding was made available this summer for youth organizations and churches to conduct positive youth programming on Saturday evenings."

"116CUL033_259_497","As you begin that process this year, I would like to ask you to consider helping young people in Marion County toward more positive youth development by becoming a supporter of the Marion County Commission on Youth, Inc."
"116CUL033_504_706","MCCOY Inc., originally founded as a government agency but re-organized in 1993 as an independent not-for-profit, is a county-wide youth services coordinating, planning, and convening agency."

"116CUL033_863_1061","In addition to that behind-the-scenes role, MCCOY has taken an out-front role in developing a Summer Bus Pass, neighborhood youth councils, and the We Value Youth information line."
"116CUL033_1062_1241","It is our goal that every young person in Marion County have access to the programs and services that can best assist them in their growth toward a positive adulthood."
"116CUL033_1248_1388","I am hopeful that you as an individual and Meridian Insurance as a corporation might consider becoming sustaining supporters of MCCOY."
"116CUL033_1389_1561","I have enclosed a packet of information about MCCOY and its work as well as an application with various options for supporting the youth of our community."

"116CUL034_40_65","Name Address City, ST Zip"
"116CUL034_72_82","Dear Name:"
"116CUL034_89_219","In the summer of 1993, the Marion County Commission on Youth began what can best be described as a ""new era"" in its history."
"116CUL034_220_327","MCCOY was reorganized as an independent, not-for-profit agency, separate from local government."
"116CUL034_328_548","It retained, however, the same mission with which it had been charged from its inception: to serve as a catalyst for effective, coordinated, and collaborative service delivery to youth in our community."
"116CUL034_555_789","For the past three years, MCCOY has been actively engaged in accomplishing this declared mission in cooperation with many others: youth service providers, youth, funding bodies, and interested citizens to name a few."
"116CUL034_796_978","We have met with a number of successes along the way, most notably the Summer Fun Line, the Metro Summer Bus Pass, and the development of ten neighborhood youth councils."
"116CUL034_979_1118","A Providers Council and a Youth Coalition are building relationships that will hopefully bear great fruit in the years to come."
"116CUL034_1119_1359","The formation of The Community Academy, a pilot project directed at expelled students from local school systems, has come about as a result of MCCOY's efforts to mobilize community agencies in response to a pressing issue."
"116CUL034_1366_1602","McCoy is actively represented and working with numerous community collaborations where we regularly raise our voice to speak out for the inclusion of young people in both decision-making and program planning processes."
"116CUL034_1603_1818","One concrete example is a joint project undertaken in the United Northwest Area in partnership with The Junior League of Indianapolis and Community Partnerships with Youth from Fort Wayne, Indiana."
"116CUL034_1819_2067","As a team, these three organizations are working with neighborhood youth and adults to build a ""Caring Neighborhood with Youth"" , mobilizing the assets of young people and adults as partners to build a better neighborhood for all."
"116CUL034_2074_2422","Since its re-organization, MCCOY has established its unique niche within the community by refraining from direct service programming and focusing on what it does best: helping to identify youth needs, convening groups of individuals and organizations which can address those needs, and moving toward collaborative solutions."
"116CUL034_2423_2505","McCoy has only one interest: the well being of Marion County's young people."
"116CUL034_2512_2631","McCoy invites the support of The __ Company Foundation in the amount of $10,000.00 to support such activities as:"
"116CUL034_2638_2804","---- the co-ordination of youth leadership training and youth empowerment efforts at the neighborhood level by means of neighborhood-based youth councils;"
"116CUL034_2805_2864","---- the promotion of youth employment opportunities;"
"116CUL034_2865_2973","---- the facilitation of ongoing discussions regarding effective and efficient youth service delivery;"
"116CUL034_2980_3105","---- the provision of technical assistance and guidance to neighborhoods which seek positive youth-adult relationships;"
"116CUL034_3112_3224","---- the development of community-wide supports for the positive growth of all Marion County young people."
"116CUL034_3231_3425","In the last several years, the business and corporate community has recognized that the positive development of youth is directly related to the development of a competent workforce."
"116CUL034_3426_3634","Youth who are supported and encouraged by both a family and a society that values Them have a much greater likelihood of becoming productive and contributing members of adult society."
"116CUL034_3635_3760","While we have made significant inroads, there remains much to be done and it is clear that we cannot do it alone."
"116CUL034_3761_3935","We seek the financial support of the Foundation to help us be successful in creating the atmosphere in our community where young people can grow and develop well."
"116CUL034_3936_4115","Your contribution will enable us to both continue and expand the good work we have begun in making Indianapolis a city famous for its commitment to youth and families."
"116CUL034_4122_4331","In our fund raising efforts to date, we have received the support of local government, foundations, and corporations as well as the personal financial commitments of individual MCCOY Board members."

"118CWL048_61_71","Dear Name,"
"118CWL048_78_106","It's tough growing up today."
"118CWL048_107_216","We know that children do better when they have a network of caring adults to nurture and motivate them."
"118CWL048_217_344","When young people don't have that support, they need other resources for encouragement to guide them along the way."
"118CWL048_345_468","Big Sisters helps bridge that gap by providing children with the resources they need -- Big Sisters volunteers."
"118CWL048_475_637","Big Sisters are mentors and friends who empower girls to more fully reach their potential, experience life's opportunities and perhaps begin to dream."
"118CWL048_638_834","The relationships that are formed provide strong foundations from which healthy values and strong self-confidence can grow, helping youth become strong, independent adults of tomorrow."
"118CWL048_841_919","This year we will serve over 1,000 girls through our mentoring programs."
"118CWL048_920_1005","This is an impressive number; but for each girl served, more are left unserved."
"118CWL048_1006_1066","Over 150 girls are currently waiting for a Big Sister."
"118CWL048_1073_1166","You can make an impact by supporting Big Sisters Annual Campaign and our $200,000 goal."
"118CWL048_1167_1286","If you are a regular contributor to the Annual Campaign, I encourage you to consider increasing your gift by 10%."
"118CWL048_1287_1430","If you have not supported Big Sisters in the past, please join me in doing so by completing and returning the enclosed pledge form."
"118CWL048_1437_1492","Early adolescence is the most vulnerable age for youth."
"118CWL048_1493_1549","But caring adults like you can reach out and help."
"118CWL048_1550_1608","It's the perfect time to make a world of difference."

"118CWL049_58_70","Adolescence."
"118CWL049_71_216","It is a pivotal time in the life of a young girl-when small changes in her behavior, or the choices she makes, can affect her future."
"118CWL049_217_304","It's hard enough for her to make good decisions when she's surrounded by support."
"118CWL049_305_337","It's even harder when she isn't."
"118CWL049_344_462","Big Sisters helps fill that void by matching caring, responsible adult volunteers with at-risk girls, ages 8-14."
"118CWL049_463_669","A Big Sister is a mentor, a friend and a role model, helping a young girl to develop the self-confidence and life skills necessary to become a responsible, productive and successful adult."
"118CWL049_670_765","Your $1,000 contribution can put a mentor in a child's life-and hope in a child's future."
"118CWL049_772_1154","The results of an 18-month study completed by Public/Private Ventures showed that children participating in one-to-one Big Sister and Big Brother matches for just one year, reduced first time drug use by 46%; lowered school absenteeism by 52%; cut aggressive behavior by 33%; enhanced school performance; and improved relations with family and friends."
"118CWL049_1161_1255","This is positive proof that Big Sisters one-to-one mentoring program helps change lives."
"118CWL049_1256_1327","Today, we are offering you the opportunity to help change a life."
"118CWL049_1328_1396","By contributing $1,000 you can support one match for one year."
"118CWL049_1397_1512","This money maintains the infrastructure that fosters and supports the development of effective relationships."
"118CWL049_1513_1652","This includes a volunteer screening process, orientation, training and ongoing supervision and support by a professional staff."
"118CWL049_1659_1850","As a Matchmaker you will receive a description of ""your match"" and be identified as a Matchmaker on a plaque in the Big Sisters office, in the agency newsletter and annual report."
"118CWL049_1857_1918","Today Big Sisters serves over 1,000 girls in central Indiana."
"118CWL049_1919_1974","But for each girl served, more are left unserved."
"118CWL049_1975_2035","Over 235 girls are currently waiting for a Big Sister."
"118CWL049_2036_2156","Imagine the difference the community could make if each congregation pledged its support of one Big Sisters match!"
"118CWL049_2163_2257","I encourage you to Join me in presenting this matchmaker challenge to your congregation."

"118CWL050_769_810","With your help, we can change that."
"118CWL050_817_929","Many Little Sisters are preparing to go back to school this fall full of hope and with a positive outlook."
"118CWL050_930_1091","Thanks to our Big Sisters volunteers, these young people are self-confident, believe in themselves and are beginning to realize their full potential."
"118CWL050_1092_1209","A recent study by Public/Private Ventures (PPV) showed that girls who had a Big Sister for just one year:"

"118CWL050_2158_2235","In 1998, Big Sisters served 972 young people through its many programs."
"118CWL050_2236_2264","But the need is still great."

"aspca1_449_483","Astro had only a few days to live."
"aspca1_522_534","Dear Friend:"
"aspca1_560_697","As you read my letter, somewhere -- perhaps not far from you --someone is inflicting pain on an innocent animal ... an animal like Astro."

"audubon1_60_76","I’m outraged ..."
"audubon1_77_106","and I think you will be, too!"
"audubon1_132_395","Just imagine finding your favorite hiking trail or birding area littered with dead birds -- among the hundreds of thousands of unsuspecting and innocent creatures who were unlucky enough to consume lethal doses of a slow-acting poison spread in fields miles away."
"audubon1_421_470","And who plans to commit such a mass bird killing?"
"audubon1_496_531","The U.S. Department of Agriculture!"
"audubon1_557_754","In fact, the USDA has plans to spread poisoned rice in sunflower fields throughout the northern Great Plains targeting two million migrating blackbirds and threatening nearly 70 other bird species."
"audubon1_780_967","it’s almost unthinkable that a program this reckless could be implemented -- in view of the tragic impact that poisonous chemicals and pesticides like DDT have had on wildlife and people."
"audubon1_993_1218","Thanks to the help of caring and concerned people like you, Audubon won a temporary halt to this planned killing last spring -- but the USDA’s plans could be up and running for the next blackbird migration, unless we act now."
"audubon1_1244_1492","Let me tell you exactly what’s at stake ... and how this could set a dangerous precedent: First of all, you might wonder why blackbirds are not benefiting from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act’s prohibition against actions that cause intentional harm."
"audubon1_1518_1623","You see, the USDA found a loophole allowing these protections to be lifted for “experimental” activities."
"audubon1_1649_1841","So they applied for the right to spread poison as Dart of a “scientific experiment” -- to learn whether lowering the population of blackbirds by poisoning them will reduce sunflower crop loss."
"audubon1_1709_1732","“scientific experiment”"
"audubon1_1867_1886","Can you believe it?"
"audubon1_1887_2010","The USDA wants to conduct an “experiment” that will spread enough poison in our environment to kill two million blackbirds."
"audubon1_1916_1928","“experiment”"
"audubon1_2036_2211","And if the death of two million birds doesn’t “prove” their theory -- and show a reduction in crop loss -- they’ll likely seek the right to kill even more birds the next year!"
"audubon1_2082_2089","“prove”"
"audubon1_2237_2287","It’s time to tell the USDA, in no uncertain terms:"
"audubon1_2313_2422","“YOU WILL NOT CONDUCT MASSIVE BIRD KILLS TO BENEFIT A HANDFUL OF SPECIAL INTERESTS!”"
"audubon1_2448_2609","Because the USDA’s slow-acting pesticide takes three days to kill, its victims will likely fly many miles from the poisoned fields, before falling to the ground."
"audubon1_2635_2712","Meanwhile,blackbirds aren’t the only birds threatened directly by the poison."
"audubon1_2713_2905","We’ve noted the presence of 68 other species of grassland songbirds in the proposed poison-baited areas ... including the Bobolink, Grasshopper Sparrow, Harris’ Sparrow and Le Conte’s Sparrow."
"audubon1_2931_3092","In all, nine birds on the Federal threatened or endangered lists and 11 birds on Audubon’s WatchList of imperiled species could be found in these killing fields."
"audubon1_3118_3264","We simply cannot afford to let the government repeat the mistakes of the past ... and operate this deadly and uncontrolled experiment on wildlife."
"audubon1_3290_3433","Here’s what I need you to do, to make sure we prevail: First, I need you to sign and return your Petition to the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture."
"audubon1_3459_3698","I’ll forward your Petition, along with those from thousands of other Audubon members and supporters, urging the USDA to withdraw its cruel plan to poison blackbirds ... in favor of alternative, benign methods of protecting sunflower crops."
"audubon1_3724_3895","I can assure you that thousands of Audubon Petitions can make a difference -- just as they did in a successful battle against an adverse wetlands proposal a few years ago!"
"audubon1_3921_4121","But today’s battle is one we must win ... to block a dangerous experiment that would begin to erase 50 years of steady progress eliminating pesticides and other harmful chemicals from our environment."
"audubon1_4147_4358","That’s why I hope you’ll also agree to help even more by making a tax-deductible gift to support this crucial initiative and all of Audubon’s vital conservation work to protect birds, other wildlife and habitat."

"defenders5_31_47","ALASKA EMERGENCY"
"defenders5_57_71","Dear Defender,"
"defenders5_81_143","Look closely at this photo, and you’ll see a wolf ... running."
"defenders5_144_195","Soon this wolf won’t be merely running in the snow."
"defenders5_205_244","This wolf will be running for its life!"
"defenders5_254_345","The airplane above will be tracking her ... in order to land and immediately gun her down ."
"defenders5_365_561","You see, the Alaska legislature passed a law that once again allows any private citizen with just a $15 trapping or $25 hunting license to track wolves by aircraft and then land and gun them down."
"defenders5_562_651","This cruel, unethical wolf-hunting practice is called “same-day airborne land-and-shoot.”"
"defenders5_616_651","“same-day airborne land-and-shoot.”"
"defenders5_661_695","It was a total shock and surprise."
"defenders5_705_785","In May the Alaska legislature voted to reinstate same-day airborne wolf killing."
"defenders5_786_861","Frankly, we never thought Alaska’s anti-wolf politicians would go this far."
"defenders5_862_976","But they did, overriding Governor Tony Knowles’ veto — and ignoring the will of the majority of Alaska’s citizens."
"defenders5_986_1142","Unfortunately, this practice will begin after the first snow ... this September ... when wolves will be “can’t-miss” targets against Alaska’s snowy terrain."
"defenders5_1090_1102","“can’t-miss”"
"defenders5_1143_1207","Wolves can run fast — but they certainly can’t outrun airplanes."
"defenders5_1217_1382","Given the urgency of the situation in Alaska, Defenders needs your immediate assistance to help save Alaska’s wolves from same-day airborne land-and-shoot slaughter."
"defenders5_1392_1445","Support the Emergency Effort to Save Alaska’s Wolves."
"defenders5_1465_1619","Defenders hopes to raise at least $100,000 to help Alaskans For Wildlife, a coalition of Alaska citizens, win a citizens’ ballot initiative this November."
"defenders5_1620_1655","And we face very wealthy opponents."
"defenders5_1656_2016","So today, I urge you to do these two things: FIRST: Sign the enclosed Citizens’ Advisory Ballot to show our Alaska allies your strong personal support to reinstate the ban on “same-day airborne land-and-shoot” wolf killing in Alaska; SECOND: Rush an urgent donation to help put this measure on the ballot and win passage in November."
"defenders5_1840_1883","“same-day airborne land-and-shoot”"
"defenders5_2026_2143","The Alaska Legislature is completely out of step with the will of Alaska’s citizens and the American public at large."
"defenders5_2153_2232","Like you, the majority of Alaskans oppose same-day land-and-shoot wolf killing."
"defenders5_2233_2342","But the anti-wolf politicians in the Alaska legislature don’t care what the majority of Alaska citizens want."
"defenders5_2343_2463","And they didn’t listen to the recommendations of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, which opposed this legislation!"
"defenders5_2473_2623","They are utterly out of step with their Alaska constituents ... the state agency that manages Alaska wildlife ... and the rest of the American public!"
"defenders5_2633_2819","In the name of “wolf control,” wolf killers will predictably once again use aircraft to hunt wolves to the point of exhaustion, so that the wolves have, literally, no chance of survival."
"defenders5_2648_2663","“wolf control,”"
"defenders5_2829_2926","And if history is any guide, over the years thousands of Alaska’s wolves will be brutally killed."
"defenders5_2936_3086","Before the 1996 ban on same-day land-and-shoot, as many as 400 wolves were killed in Alaska each year because of this barbaric and unethical practice."
"defenders5_3096_3269","Anti-wolf interests are prepared to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to make sure that the new land-and-shoot law stands — even though most Alaskans do not support it."
"defenders5_3279_3417","So if we don’t act right now, Alaska’s snowy tundras will once again become bloody killing fields for wolves in America’s “Last Frontier.”"
"defenders5_3401_3417","“Last Frontier.”"
"defenders5_3427_3495","Say “NO” to the barbaric practice of same-day airborne wolf killing."
"defenders5_3431_3435","“NO”"
"defenders5_3505_3652","The only way Alaskans can repeal the new law and reinstate the ban on same-day airborne land-and-shoot wolf killing is with a Citizens’ Referendum."
"defenders5_3662_3742","That’s why your special financial support is so important — and urgently needed."
"defenders5_3752_3817","Alaska wolf advocates need your immediate support to save wolves."
"defenders5_3827_4014","As I mentioned, this new same-day airborne land-and-shoot practice will start in September after the opening of hunting season and the first snow — and when wolves will be an easy target."
"defenders5_4024_4197","To repeal this unconscionable law, Defenders must help provide our friends in Alaska -- Alaskans For Wildlife — with the resources necessary to win at the polls in November."
"defenders5_4207_4318","Our well-funded opponents will spend whatever it takes to mislead and confuse voters about this ballot measure."
"defenders5_4319_4563","We need help to supplement the funds raised by Alaskans For Wildlife for careful polling, the development of voter education spots for television, radio and newspapers, the placement of those ads, and “get-out-the-vote” efforts on election day."
"defenders5_4573_4669","If Alaska’s new law is not replaced, thousands of Alaska's wolves will die in the years to come."
"defenders5_4679_4826","And it will be a major setback for wolves nationwide — at a time when the American public overwhelmingly favors wolf reintroduction and protection."
"defenders5_4827_4961","A loss will encourage those anti-wolf fanatics who want to stop wolf restoration and put bounties on those wolves already in the wild."
"defenders5_4971_5008","So, please don’t wait another minute."
"defenders5_5018_5185","Please sign your Citizens’ Advisory Ballot to demonstrate to our Alaska allies that you’re behind them; and send an urgent donation today to help them win this effort."
"defenders5_5195_5227","So how will your money be spent?"
"defenders5_5237_5459","Here’s the projected budget breakdown: $35,000 — in-depth, state-wide survey conducted by a top pollster to determine voters’ positions on the ballot measure and arguments that will help persuade undecided voters."
"defenders5_5469_5566","$45,000 — salaries /office expenses for staff to oversee the effort between now and election day."
"defenders5_5576_5683","$30,000 — production of television and radio spots alerting the public to the findings of the above survey."
"defenders5_5693_5794","$100,000 — placement of voter education spots in the key media including print, radio and television."
"defenders5_5795_5873","Money must be in hand by mid-August to reserve time for September and October!"
"defenders5_5883_5981","$15,000 — election day “get-out-the-vote” drive, including phone calls to get voters to the polls."

"hsus4_83_197","I hope you’ll use the enclosed name labels, and colorful pet stickers, designed especially for friends of animals."
"hsus4_223_411","Your name -- and the name of The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) -- are very important to the well-being of all animals because together we can prevent suffering and save lives."
"hsus4_437_562","I wish I could tell you that everyone is concerned about protecting earth’s animals -- dogs, cats, farm animals and wildlife."
"hsus4_563_693","The sad truth is animal cruelty, abuse and neglect continues at an alarming rate across the nation and even in your own community."
"hsus4_719_995","Every day of the year, The Humane Society of the United States receives reports about all kinds of animal cruelties, such as the horrors of the leghold trap; the use of dog and cat fur; needless or repetitive experiments on animals; and the abusive treatment of dogs and cats."
"hsus4_1021_1298","Still others are less obvious but just as horrible; dogs fighting to the death for the benefit of blood thirsty gamblers; baby calves confined and malnourished to provide “milk-fed” veal for the gourmet; and the “accidental” drowning of porpoises in the nets of tuna fishermen."
"hsus4_1192_1202","“milk-fed”"
"hsus4_1233_1245","“accidental”"
"hsus4_1299_1383","And almost 6,000,000 companion pets are put to death in shelters throughout America."
"hsus4_1409_1519","What is even more shocking, is that more than 30 million animals die these cruel, painful deaths each year ..."
"hsus4_1520_1565","needless deaths that could have been stopped!"
"hsus4_1591_1878","And with so much animal cruelty and suffering going on, I’m sure you can understand why the work of The Humane Society of the United States is so vitally important and why we need the support of many other people, like you, to help us bring an end to animal suffering, abuse and neglect."
"hsus4_1904_2146","Since 1954, our programs and activities have been aimed at stopping and eliminating all animal abuse and we continue to spend a great deal of time investigating animal cruelty cases and working with the courts to prosecute the guilty parties."
"hsus4_2172_2348","We also work hard and lobby for better animal welfare laws at the local, state and federal government levels and we insist they enforce existing laws to prevent animal cruelty."
"hsus4_2374_2587","Our primary goal, though, has always been to stop the cruel and inhumane treatment of animals before it happens, so we teach the public about the need to protect all animals from suffering, abuse and exploitation."
"hsus4_2613_2817","But while our programs and activities have been successful in reducing animal cruelty, we are constantly faced with new problems of animal suffering which need immediate attention and drain our resources."
"hsus4_2830_2993","It’s a difficult problem, because we have to fight the well-financed and powerful agri-business and research industries, but we do our best to protect the animals."
"hsus4_3019_3115","Right now, the problems are mounting and we need all the help we can get to stop animal cruelty."
"hsus4_3141_3171","And that’s where you can help."
"hsus4_3172_3364","You can be a lifesaving “friend” to all animals by telling friends and family about the important work of The HSUS and asking them to become vigilant in safe-guarding the lives of ALL animals."

"20020731-nyt_46015_46164","But the Bush plan falls well short of the only other credible proposal on the table, a bill sponsored by Sen. James Jeffords, Independent of Vermont."

"NYTnewswire5_418_590","SAN FRANCISCO -- A staple of Chinese and Indian cooking, these gourds (botanically, Momordica charantia) with skin like toads grow on climbing vines that can reach 12 feet."
"NYTnewswire5_591_647","The Chinese and Indian varieties differ little in taste."
"NYTnewswire5_648_820","Though they resemble squashes, they are natives to Asia, rather than the Americas, but are now cultivated in many regions of the world that boast moderate to warm climates."

"NYTnewswire5_1031_1103","Right now, some particularly nice ones are in Bay Area farmers' markets."
"NYTnewswire5_1109_1261","HOW TO SELECT As the gourd ripens, its color changes from near white-pale green to vivid green, often flecked with yellow, and eventually bright orange."
"NYTnewswire5_1262_1329","When young, the flavor is relatively mild, with a fresh, sour note."
"NYTnewswire5_1330_1409","As it ripens, it gets progressively more bitter due to the quinine it contains."
"NYTnewswire5_1415_1486","PRICE Bitter melon was selling for 79 cents to $1.99 a pound last week."
"NYTnewswire5_1492_1592","USES Bitter melons are used in many Asian cuisines, most prominently Indian, Chinese and Vietnamese."
"NYTnewswire5_1593_1703","Generally, they are halved lengthwise, the seeds and fibrous pulp removed and the flesh sliced into crescents."

"NYTnewswire6_864_1190","First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded)."
"NYTnewswire6_1196_1381","Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member."
"NYTnewswire6_1387_1626","Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion."
"NYTnewswire6_1632_1876","The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities."
"NYTnewswire6_1882_2122","When the Pasadena native moved back to California from her long-time home in the Boston area last year, she also made the move from a condominium she and her late husband, Paul, had purchased many years ago to a progressive retirement home."

"NYTnewswire6_2843_3037","Though she had a ""nice"" kitchen installed in her new home, Child said it's like a ship's galley -- a far cry from the huge, three-pantry kitchen Paul Child designed for their house in Cambridge."
"NYTnewswire6_3038_3186","That may well be the best-known kitchen in America, since it became the site of the ""French Chef"" television programs, which started airing in 1962."
"NYTnewswire6_3192_3278","""Back there, we always ate in the kitchen,"" Child reminisced, ""I cannot do that here."""

"NYTnewswire6_4581_4807","It will undoubtedly retell how the seeds of her culinary career were sown: Fresh off the boat on their way to Paris and Paul Child's new posting (they had met in Sri Lanka during World War II), they stopped for lunch in Rouen."
"NYTnewswire6_4808_5089","That lunch lit a spark that made Julia decide to take classes at the Cordon Bleu, which in turn led to her friendship and collaboration with Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle, co-authors of ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking,"" and, ultimately, to America's culinary revolution."

"wsj_1640_9_181","Electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing U.S. companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage."
"wsj_1640_182_323","That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage."
"wsj_1640_324_609","""Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies,"" said Noel D. Matchett, a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc., Silver Spring, Md."
"wsj_1640_610_876","It ""may well be"" that theft of business data is ""as serious a strategic threat to national security"" as it is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms, said Michelle Van Cleave, the White House's assistant director for National Security Affairs."
"wsj_1640_880_1091","The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association, a joint industry-government trade group."
"wsj_1640_1092_1179","Any secret can be pirated, the experts said, if it is transmitted over the air."
"wsj_1640_1180_1336","Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder."
"wsj_1640_1337_1417","They need only position themselves near a company's satellite dish and wait."
"wsj_1640_1418_1576","""You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time,"" Mr. Matchett said, adding : ""It's a pretty good bet they won't get caught."""
"wsj_1640_1577_1677","The only way to catch an electronic thief, he said, is to set him up with erroneous information."
"wsj_1640_1681_1819","Even though electronic espionage may cost U.S. firms billions of dollars a year, most aren't yet taking precautions, the experts said."
"wsj_1640_1820_1959","By contrast, European firms will spend $150 million this year on electronic security, and are expected to spend $1 billion by 1992."
"wsj_1640_1960_2074","Already many foreign firms, especially banks, have their own cryptographers, conference speakers reported."
"wsj_1640_2075_2147","Still, encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy."
"wsj_1640_2151_2462","One expert, whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on condition that he wouldn't be named or quoted, said the expected influx of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer-maintenance workers, for example, doubling as foreign spies."
"wsj_1640_2463_2592","Moreover, he said, technology now exists for stealing corporate secrets after they've been ""erased"" from a computer's memory."
"wsj_1640_2597_2773","He said that Oliver North of Iran-Contra notoriety thought he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved for congressional committees to read."

"wsj_1640_2878_3106","W. Mark Goode, president of Micronyx Inc., a Richardson, Texas, firm that makes computer-security products, provided a new definition for Mikhail Gorbachev's campaign for greater openness, known commonly as glasnost."

"wsj_1640_3214_3363","He cited the case of a Swiss oil trader who recently put out bids via telex for an oil tanker to pick up a cargo of crude in the Middle East."
"wsj_1640_3364_3506","Among the responses the Swiss trader got was one from the Soviet national shipping company, which hadn't been invited to submit a bid."

"wsj_2465_270_334","Over the past 12 years, at least 40 journalists have died there."
"wsj_2465_335_493","The attacks have intensified since the Colombian government began cracking down on the traffickers in August, trying to prevent their takeover of the country."

"wsj_2465_909_1040","The paper's local administrator, Maria Luz Lopez, was shot dead, and her mother wounded, while her car was stopped for a red light."

"HistoryLasVegas_27_42","A Brief History"
"HistoryLasVegas_51_67","Early Habitation"
"HistoryLasVegas_76_213","The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake."
"HistoryLasVegas_222_339","During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline."
"HistoryLasVegas_340_425","The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries."
"HistoryLasVegas_426_500","The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated."
"HistoryLasVegas_501_578","Fossils tell an obscure story of man’s slow and sporadic development."
"HistoryLasVegas_587_694","Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture."
"HistoryLasVegas_695_904","By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas."
"HistoryLasVegas_905_1010","These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River."
"HistoryLasVegas_1011_1134","The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife."
"HistoryLasVegas_1135_1244","Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis."
"HistoryLasVegas_1253_1364","For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization."
"HistoryLasVegas_1365_1511","Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley."
"HistoryLasVegas_1512_1663","Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest."
"HistoryLasVegas_1664_1837","This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife."
"HistoryLasVegas_1846_2015","Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d. 1150, leaving it to be repopulated by the Southern Paiutes, another hunter-gatherer tribe."
"HistoryLasVegas_2024_2254","Unable to replicate the agricultural techniques of the Anasazi, the Paiutes were destined to a semi-nomadic lifestyle until European settlers arrived, changing the nature of existence in the valley forever."
"HistoryLasVegas_2263_2286","From Mailmen to Mormons"
"HistoryLasVegas_2295_2396","In the early nineteenth century, America’s western territories were still largely unexplored."
"HistoryLasVegas_2397_2629","It was not until 1829 that Rafael Rivera, a Mexican scout, found a spring-fed valley and dubbed it Las Vegas — a Spanish name that leaves many modern visitors wondering exactly where “the meadows” really lay."
"HistoryLasVegas_2638_2715","For fifteen years, Las Vegas was used as a Spanish Trail way-station."
"HistoryLasVegas_2716_2914","In 1844, American explorer John C. Fremont parked his horses at Big Springs, and his report to the government resulted in a mail route leading past the spot on its way to California."
"HistoryLasVegas_2915_3018","This put Las Vegas on the map and was one of the crucial turning points of its history."
"HistoryLasVegas_3027_3232","In 1855, Mormon leader Brigham Young responded to promising reports of Las Vegas by sending 30 missionary settlers to the valley; they eventually built a fort not far from today’s Downtown."
"HistoryLasVegas_3233_3402","Surrounded by acres of farmland hewn from the hard desert, the adobe fort became a focal point for the development of Las Vegas for the next fifty years."
"HistoryLasVegas_3411_3598","The missionaries struggled valiantly against the dictates of the desert, trying simultaneously to survive the harshness of their circumstances and spread the Mormon faith."
"HistoryLasVegas_3599_3697","Additional pressures from arriving miners pushed the missionaries’ plight beyond recovery."
"HistoryLasVegas_3698_3816","Their supplies scarce, their harvest meager, and their spirit broken, they abandoned the fort in 1858."
"HistoryLasVegas_3825_4028","Despite the fact that the local land was rich in silver, by 1865 most of the mining traffic through Las Vegas was of prospectors headed to California or Northern Nevada in search of gold."
"HistoryLasVegas_4029_4090","One opportunist who stayed was Octavius Decatur Gass."
"HistoryLasVegas_4091_4325","Bestowed with plenty of the invaluable pioneer spirit that characterizes Las Vegas to this day, Gass redirected his life by picking up where the Mormons left off — at least when it came to ranching and farming."
"HistoryLasVegas_4326_4459","Gass took over the abandoned Mormon fort and 640 acres (260 hectares) surrounding it, dubbing it the Las Vegas Ranch."
"HistoryLasVegas_4460_4555","He expanded the ranch and irrigated the land so that it would support crops and cattle."
"HistoryLasVegas_4556_4684","His determination had other results as well: Gass was named a justice of the peace and a territorial legislator."
"HistoryLasVegas_4693_4745","Despite his ambition, Gass’ success was short-lived."
"HistoryLasVegas_4746_4884","In the late 1870s, he defaulted on a loan from rancher Archibald Stewart, so Stewart took the Las Vegas Ranch for his own."
"HistoryLasVegas_4885_5048","True to wild-West stereotypes, Stewart was slain by a neighboring farmer, leaving his strong-willed wife, Helen, to assume the duties of the ranch."
"HistoryLasVegas_5049_5185","Through 1905, Helen Stewart expanded the ranch to 2000 acres (810 hectares), making quite a bit of money in the process."
"HistoryLasVegas_5194_5384","What happened next would mark the end of the successful Las Vegas Ranch and the beginning of the era of the subdivision seen across almost all of Western America to this day."
"HistoryLasVegas_5385_5479","The railroad was coming, and when it arrived, Las Vegas would never be the same again."
"HistoryLasVegas_5488_5508","Of Tracks and Tracts"
"HistoryLasVegas_5517_5652","At the turn of the 19th century Los Angeles and Salt Lake City were among the burgeoning metropolises of the new American West."
"HistoryLasVegas_5661_5751","Though the two cities remained unlinked by rail, this was about to change quickly."
"HistoryLasVegas_5752_5879","When it did, the Las Vegas Valley (which at the time had a non-native population of less than 30) would change as well."
"HistoryLasVegas_5888_6073","In 1903, officials of the San Pedro, Los Angeles, and Salt Lake Railroad arrived in Las Vegas, eager to secure a right-of-way for their Los Angeles–Salt Lake connection."
"HistoryLasVegas_6074_6155","Las Vegas would serve as a major stopover for crew rest and train repair."
"HistoryLasVegas_6156_6203","For all this, the railroad needed land."
"HistoryLasVegas_6204_6291","As mapped, the track traveled directly through Helen Stewart’s Las Vegas Ranch."
"HistoryLasVegas_6292_6355","Stewart sold 99.5 percent of her ranch to the railroad."
"HistoryLasVegas_6356_6405","The remainder she returned to the native Paiutes."
"HistoryLasVegas_6414_6577","In early 1905, the route between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City was completed, and train tracks bore right down the center of the Las Vegas Valley."
"HistoryLasVegas_6578_6672","On 15 May 1905, the railroad held a land sale — a momentous step in Las Vegas history."
"HistoryLasVegas_6673_6840","Standing at the depot at Main and Fremont streets, railroad officials auctioned 1200 lots they had subdivided from forty square blocks of desert scrub."
"HistoryLasVegas_6841_7027","Land speculators and locals alike were anxious to own a part of the newest railroad boomtown, and within an afternoon, more than 80 percent of the lots were sold."
"HistoryLasVegas_7036_7087","Las Vegas was no longer a small pioneer settlement."
"HistoryLasVegas_7088_7204","With rail service in place and forty blocks of private property, it was ready to become a real town."
"HistoryLasVegas_7205_7355","Businesses sprang up overnight, and wooden houses were erected to replace the tent city in which many of the early settlers had lived."
"HistoryLasVegas_7356_7515","One year after the auction, the population of Las Vegas had ballooned to 1500 residents, a portent of things to come for the next ninety years."
"HistoryLasVegas_7524_7537","Dam Good Luck"
"HistoryLasVegas_7546_7605","From the beginning, Las Vegas was built to serve travelers."
"HistoryLasVegas_7614_7677","The railroad needed a way station, and Las Vegas was the place."
"HistoryLasVegas_7678_7875","Growth continued for ten years, and by 1915 the town had telephones, round-the-clock electricity, and a growing population — many of whom worked in the railroad repair shop."
"HistoryLasVegas_7876_7934","But such heady progress would soon come to a halt."
"HistoryLasVegas_7943_8057","The growing competition in rail transport resulted in Union Pacific buying the Los Angeles–Salt Lake line."
"HistoryLasVegas_8058_8156","Union Pacific then consolidated its operations, eliminating the Las Vegas repair facility."
"HistoryLasVegas_8165_8307","Additionally, Las Vegas had been made a part of Nevada’s new Clark County in 1909, a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling."
"HistoryLasVegas_8316_8487","These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the status of a small desert community that could no longer support its 3000 residents."
"HistoryLasVegas_8488_8677","But the southwest’s growing need for water, combined with Las Vegas’s fortuitous proximity to the Colorado River, would give Las Vegas a second chance to achieve prosperity."
"HistoryLasVegas_8686_8887","Construction on Hoover Dam (originally Boulder Dam, subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project) began in 1931 in a canyon 45 miles (72 km) southeast of Las Vegas."
"HistoryLasVegas_8896_9079","Providing an influx of $165 million to the southwestern economy, Hoover Dam played a major role in preventing Las Vegas from drying up, both financially and literally."
"HistoryLasVegas_9080_9230","Not only did it create jobs, but it also created Lake Mead, the massive reservoir that today provides water to all of southern Nevada."
"HistoryLasVegas_9239_9259","More Government Help"
"HistoryLasVegas_9268_9355","The construction of Hoover Dam did not single-handedly save Las Vegas, however."
"HistoryLasVegas_9356_9559","The state legislature helped as well, by legalizing gambling in 1931 and thus solidifying the future of the town, though legislators and residents could never have known this at the time."
"HistoryLasVegas_9568_9714","The hordes of people who attended Hoover Dam’s 1935 dedication set the city’s now-formidable public relations machine into action."
"HistoryLasVegas_9715_9824","They went to work on what has become one of the lengthiest citywide tourism campaigns ever attempted."
"HistoryLasVegas_9825_9947","It didn’t take long for the city to establish itself as a wild-West town with an “anything goes” attitude."
"HistoryLasVegas_9948_10061","Vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal here, available any hour of any day (or night)."
"HistoryLasVegas_10062_10132","Thus originated Las Vegas’s reputation as an adult theme park."
"HistoryLasVegas_10141_10217","Additional catalysts for the valley’s growth came from World War II."
"HistoryLasVegas_10218_10475","Both the Las Vegas Aerial Gunnery School (which became Nellis Air Force Base and the Nevada Test Site) in the north, and Basic Magnesium in the nearby town of Henderson, arrived in the early 1940s as a result of America’s war effort."
"HistoryLasVegas_10476_10586","By 1945, the population had grown to almost 20,000, with workers and airmen moving in at a rapid pace."
"HistoryLasVegas_10595_10642","But this was not yet the Las Vegas of folklore."
"HistoryLasVegas_10651_10675","Mobsters and Rat Packers"
"HistoryLasVegas_10684_10867","While many gambling halls opened Downtown in the 1930s and early 1940s, only two were built on the stretch of old Los Angeles Highway that ultimately became the Strip."
"HistoryLasVegas_10868_10955","The El Rancho Vegas (1941) was the first, followed by the Last Frontier (1943)."
"HistoryLasVegas_10956_11089","During this period, East Coast Syndicate member Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel earned a foothold as a local casino operator."
"HistoryLasVegas_11098_11246","By 1945 Siegel had become one of Las Vegas’s original visionaries, planning an opulent resort on the southern end of the LA Highway."
"HistoryLasVegas_11247_11353","When the Flamingo opened in December 1946, it did so with Hollywood flair and the new Vegas flash."
"HistoryLasVegas_11354_11498","But the Mafia bosses who financed the operation were displeased with its performance; Siegel was murdered in the summer of 1947."
"HistoryLasVegas_11507_11612","Despite its initial failings, Siegel’s Flamingo survived him, as did mob infiltration of casinos."
"HistoryLasVegas_11613_11709","In fact, the Flamingo would launch over two decades of strong mob presence in Las Vegas."
"HistoryLasVegas_11710_11939","Freely flowing “comps” (complimentary food, drink, and entertainment) were the order of the day, with mob bosses content to provide an environment of pleasurable excess as long as the cash kept rolling in."
"HistoryLasVegas_11948_12074","While the mob was running the casinos, promoters were busily selling Las Vegas as a glamorous Hollywood in the desert."
"HistoryLasVegas_12075_12217","From the mid-1940s to the mid-1960s, Las Vegas nurtured a growing sense that it was the “Entertainment Capital of the World. ”"
"HistoryLasVegas_12218_12346","Emerging stars, no longer content with playing small nightclubs, came to Las Vegas with dreams of making it big."
"HistoryLasVegas_12347_12364","Many of them did."
"HistoryLasVegas_12365_12559","Frank Sinatra, Wayne Newton, and Louis Prima each arrived with mediocre status and suddenly found themselves with names as big as the marquees on which they were written."
"HistoryLasVegas_12560_12770","The Rat Pack — originally Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. , Peter Lawford, and Joey Bishop, all in town to film Ocean’s 11 — landed at the Sands in January 1960 for a legendary stay."
"HistoryLasVegas_12771_12868","Other Hollywood stars came as well, simply because Las Vegas was the place to be."
"HistoryLasVegas_12877_12927","As a result, more casinos emerged along the Strip."
"HistoryLasVegas_12928_13163","The Thunderbird, Desert Inn, Sahara, Sands, and Riviera hotels were erected during this period, luring a curious clientele drawn by tales of all-night partying, exclusive entertainment, and cheap accommodations."
"HistoryLasVegas_13172_13286","There was no longer any question: when you wanted some unbridled adult fun, Las Vegas was the place to be."
"HistoryLasVegas_13295_13309","New Legitimacy"
"HistoryLasVegas_13318_13431","Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas — corporate cash."
"HistoryLasVegas_13432_13644","Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities."
"HistoryLasVegas_13653_13743","That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes."
"HistoryLasVegas_13744_13871","A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos."
"HistoryLasVegas_13872_13980","True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn’s penthouse."
"HistoryLasVegas_13981_14172","Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management."
"HistoryLasVegas_14173_14258","Thus began Hughes’ legendary three-year, $300-million Las Vegas buying spree."
"HistoryLasVegas_14259_14424","When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains."
"HistoryLasVegas_14433_14521","Hughes’ actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting."
"HistoryLasVegas_14522_14857","Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes’ investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant."
"HistoryLasVegas_14858_15018","That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city."
"HistoryLasVegas_15027_15050","Las Vegas with a Vision"
"HistoryLasVegas_15059_15151","As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged."
"HistoryLasVegas_15152_15239","The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US."
"HistoryLasVegas_15240_15304","What was once a sure thing became much more competitive."
"HistoryLasVegas_15305_15375","Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business."
"HistoryLasVegas_15384_15486","The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget."
"HistoryLasVegas_15487_15574","In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort."
